So, I flew American ($395 round trip!).  Two flights each out and back, and in each flight I was in the last boarding group:  Group 9 (aka Steerage Class).  \n\nEach time they go through their announcements, Pre-boarding, Eline Members, Active Military, Group 1, Group 2, and so on.  \n\nAnd on each flight, which was 95-100% full, they stressed multiple times before boarding and during boarding that \"WARNING WARNING! WE ARE GOING TO HAVE FULL PLANE!  WE ARE GOING TO RUN OUT OF OVERHEAD SPACE FOR THE LAST TWO GROUPS!!!! CHECK YOUR BAGS NOW FOR FREE!!!!!\"\n\nAnd, of course, on each of the four flights, even though the seats were stuffed and people brought more than they were supposed to, there was still space available in the overhead bins at the end.  \n\nI suspect a good chunk of those early line jumpers are worried about running out of room for their bags, so that's why they try to get on early.  American pushes the \"WE WILL RUN OUT OF ROOM!\" so much, and they keep repeating it whether it's remotely true or not, I can imagine people stressing out about it.",

Like they couldn\u2019t have sorted that out and got another pilot before he decided to fly??? We had to be put on another flight the next day and TAP didn\u2019t pay for any hotel accommodations.  One African passenger had to sleep at the airport because he didn\u2019t have a visa for Europe. They gave a meal voucher for maybe 20 euro for all our trouble. Horrible company.",
      "The only reason airlines are doing this is so they can charge people for priority boarding.\n\nOtherwise they wouldn\u2019t care.\n\nAirlines created the issue by charging for checked bags. And now they get to charge for priority boarding with this \u201cfix\u201d.",
      "Take it a step further and if someone tries to scan to early, their ticket automatically changes to the last boarding group. And that group will be a new group called the Losers or whatever. \u201cNow can all the losers board the aircraft\u201d. Have their name displayed on the screens too. Would nip this problem right in the bud.",

      "Probably wasn\u2019t a requirement when the software was designed. Someone assumed humans would have self control and wait their turn.",
      "Because airlines make more money the quicker they get the airplane into the air. Gate agents are under enormous pressure to close the gate as soon as possible so they never bothered with enforcing the order of groups.\n\nIn the past, this was never really a problem until airlines started charging fees for everything; including checking your bags. So naturally, more people are bringing carryons now. Airplanes are not really designed to have all passengers bring their own carryon so they run out of space if you are one of the last to board. They usually gate check it without a fee but that means you have to wait for your bag once you land.\n\nThis is simply airlines \"solving\" a problem which they created in the first place.",

Means I beat the crush of people all trying to do the same thing at the same time.\n\nMy wife and I once flew to London with some neighbors. They were going to go do their thing. And we did ours.

      "Yeah, if I don't have a carry on that has to go in the bin, I'll walk on after the agent starts looking around for people. But, otherwise, on typical US domestic routes I'm flying economy with a carry on, and I'll sit on the plane for 10 extra minutes so that I don't have to wait at the airport an extra 20-30 minutes after I land for my bag.",

      "It makes the boarding experience faster for everybody though? I think the most annoying part of traveling is when everybody is just standing single file in the aisle waiting for the line to slowly lurch forward. If people board randomly then there is less time spent doing exactly that.",
      "This. I do the exact same. We were flying back this past week and we're in a low numbered boarding group for some reason. We were the last to board. I don't need to be in that sardine can longer than necessary. Which worked out because the que to take off was over 15 aircraft long.",

      "Getting priority to getting off as soon as possible should be exclusive to those who have a layover far as i'm concerned.\n\nApart from that, i often travel with a duffle bag that's *just* small enough to fit into the hand luggage and thus don't have anything but carry-on. I really prefer leaving early since - unlike most - i can go straight to customs instead of having to wait for luggage. Could save me a bit of time. But it's never been a serious concern, so unless i'm in front, i don't bother and just take it easy.",
      "I don't care when I get on or off. What has started to piss me off is how everyone used to have 1 carry-on bag that they were actually allowed to carry on, now they tell everyone they can bring 1 carry-on bag but only let the first 30% of people to board bring them before declaring everyone else has to gate-check theirs.\n\nI always get an immediate blood pressure spike when I get to my gate and see everyone sitting there with an elephant-sized \"carry-on\" that is gonna take up 4 spaces in the overhead bin compared to my normal-sized one that is gonna get forcibly taken away from me because I'm in group 6 lol.",

      "Two things. \n\nThey aren\u2019t counting the number of bags everyone puts in the overhead. Destinations like Hawaii often have a high number of carryons. \n\nThe gate agents job is to get the correct people on the plane and the plane out on time. The cases where they have to hunt for a spot or 3 to put a bag and rearrange things delays pushback. \n\nThey often make the latter groups check their bags despite maybe a few being able to fit on the plane to save time.",

    "text": "When I was traveling from Islamabad to Dubai, the uncle sitting behind me literally coughed for 3 hours straight, non-stop. It was relentless. The moment we landed, he magically stopped coughing like nothing had happened. I thought I was finally free, but no.\n\nI had a 2-hour transit before my next flight to Kuala Lumpur, and guess what? The same uncle ended up sitting in the front row on my next flight. He started the same coughing routine again for the entire 7-hour flight. It was like some kind of sick joke!\n\nI\u2019ve never felt so trapped and uncomfortable during a journey. Definitely my worst travel experience ever. Anyone else dealt with something this annoying while flying? Let\u2019s hear your horror stories!",

      "Once I went with a shared car from the same city (Islamabad) to Gilgit Baltistan and the family behind me was vomiting the whole trip. We also drove over a puppy, and everybody laughed, didnt't even stop to check. Awful awful.",
      "My first time in Thailand, I took a bus to the ferry to get to Koh Phangan. The bus was not only LOUD AF with Thai music blasting, and lights blazing, but was also COLD AF. You know Thailand really loves AC. The seats had a mechanism where you could raise your legs like a lazyboy. I had my feet under the seat in front of me, except I had no idea that part of the mechanism was an exposed lever/bar under the seat, so when the girl in front was ready to go off she pulled the lever to lower the mechanism and I felt a sharp pain as the lever underneath snapped my toenail off. Now I have paranoia about wearing open two sandals anywhere outside of the beach. \n\nIt didn't help that the ferry dock didn't have a proper washroom, and I was digging into my backpack trying desperately to find my soap to clean it as I had chickens running around me.",
      "Middle seat of a five-seat row, Asiana Airlines from LA to Seoul, 1993.  They allowed smoking in your seat and every person on this jam-packed flight was smoking except me.  Thirteen+ hours of non-stop smoking.  Persons on both sides of me literally lit a fresh cig with the dying ember of the last one.  I was sick for three days, had to put my clothes in a trash bin.  I paid out of pocket about $300 (back when that was real money) for a non-smoking section flight on the return.",
      "I've always been a nervous flyer. I don't like to eat before flying, but I'll take a drink. I had a 4-5 hour flight to Greece where there was turbulence and seatbelt signs almost the whole time. \n\nI had no choice but to wait to landing before peeing. However when I got off, the toilets were out of order for 10 mins while being cleaned and I had a bus driver rushing me, so I just had to hop on the bus and hope it wasn't far. \n\nIt was over an hour. I was struggling, I was actually holding my empty drinks bottle wondering if I could sneakily do it on a busy bus. In the end I waited and got there like 11pm and that almighty pain came to an end. Then I woke up at 3am with some kind of virus or food poisoning. Terrible start!\n\nBecause it was middle of the night and I hadn't a chance to get any water in, I had to go out and find an open bar (just closing actually) and beg them to sell me a bottle of water. Hell.",
      "Hopefully just dry cabin air was causing the coughing. Annoying, but hopefully nothing to do with illness.\n\nWorst for me was a very, very harsh landing after an engine sucked in geese. Terrifying.\n\nStrictly merely annoying? A woman in a seat next to me waited until we were up in the air, then proceeded to take out a little bottle of essential lavender oil and daub it all over her arms and neck. My eyes were watering, the scent was so strong. What a selfish, gross thing to do. Ugh.",
      "When healing from a sore throat I get the exact same couching fits when I enter any enclosed place. When outside I don't feel anything but once I step on a bus it gets so bad. I literally had to get off the bus once halfway because I thought I would suffocate and I had no drink with me. I'm so glad that it stopped a few days ago because I didn't wanna be the person coughing the entirety of my 5hr flight.",
      "I recently paid out of my own pocket for an international business class flight (expensive).  I was aisle, and across the aisle from me was an older man coughing and sneezing. I watched his wife give him cold medicine as we got ready for takeoff.\n\nI keep a medical grade N95 mask with me whenever I travel, and wore it virtually the whole flight, and didn't get sick, but this was annoying since normally in business class you get to enjoy an endless supply of food and drinks.  I did eat and drink a little, but tried to do it as qiuckly as possible.\n\nSo, next time, bring a good mask and hope for the best.",
      "Some time back, I was traveling for a vacation immediately after getting my wisdom teeth extraction done. I had to take Amoxicillin and that gave me the worst case of dry coughs I've ever had. Felt bad for my fellow passengers, but I was also in a world of hurt as I had forgotten my pain killers in the checked-in bag. Once we landed, the coughing eased away. Apologies to you on behalf of the coughing uncle",
      "My story. I am allergic to vanilla. The taste and smell of vanilla make me sneeze and have trouble breathing. Once, I was on a long flight from Moscow to Vietnam. The woman next to me smelled strongly of vanilla. I coughed and sneezed for 3 hours. People around me were really angry but I tried to explaine everyone that I had an allergy and  my medicine wasn\u2019t helping because her perfume was so strong. Finally, I was moved to business class and after 30 minutes I felt better",
      "My worst one was a 12 hour milk run (6 stops) on my way to the Arctic sitting in the last row (5 small seats) of a Dash 8-300 between two morbidly obese people. One of them was coughing and the other one wouldn't shut up. It was so tight, I had to sit bending forward with my arms squeezed as there wasn't even enough space to rest my back on the seat and I couldn't move at all.\n\nAs many were going to the final destination for a big regional meeting, no seats would free up during stops and whenever someone would get off, someone else going to the meeting would get in. I had back pain for several days afterwards and ended up with a bad flu.",
      "I've been the cougher in this situation, plane air is so dry it always makes my nose run and irritates my throat :((",
      "3 months back. Fully booked British Airways flight London to Toronto. We were sitting in center aisle. The family sitting in the row behind us were connecting from India on the way to Toronto. All of them were sick. The wife and 2 daughters more than the father. Coughing non stop  . Sniffling, coughing, rubbing their noses, coughing, coughing & coughing.\n We had our masks on. We asked to move. ( no seats were available)\n  Within 2/3 days after returning home , we both had a very bad cold with the nastiest cough that took 2-3 weeks to pass.  \n   Scared for an upcoming flight in January.",
      "Family with a baby and 1-year-old twins right in front of us on a 17-hour nonstop to Singapore. The kids wailed the ENTIRE flight.\n\nTwo weeks later we board the plane for our return and guess who is sitting in front of us again\u2026",
      "Were you wearing a mask? I've started to wear one during boarding and deplaning but if someone very close to me is coughing then I will keep it on.",
      "I was on a six hour flight a couple years back and the row in front of me was two kids, all under 10 with their parents in the row across from them. From the moment the kids sat down, it was obvious they were both had really, really bad colds. They sat in front of me snuffling, blowing their noses and cough for the whole six hours. \n\nI ended up putting my mask (it was post covid mandate but I still carried some) and wore it for the whole flight. I also had lysol travel wipes that I used to wipe down my area repeatedly. \n\nBy the time the plane landed I was so dehydrated because I didn't even have a sip of water because I didn't want to take my mask off. I was so annoyed with the parents, the kids definitely should not have been flying and as we were exiting the plane, the parents told the kids to \"just leave their kleenex for the steward to clean up\".  There was literally a mountain of dirty kleenex in front of their seats. Just so gross.",
      "Serious questions: what does \"uncle\" mean in this context? I assume he wasn't your uncle, so I'm just confused as I've never seen \"uncle\" used like this before",
      "Not my worst but in the coughing topic.  Got to my departure terminal and heard a pretty sick cough echo throughout the terminal.  I remember thinking I hope I'm not on that flight and they don't sit next to me.\n\nWell turns out it was a sick child sitting diagonally a row back from me.  Pretty sure they had seats up front but they quarantined the child in the back as one of the parents would come and go to the front which probably infected the front anyways.  At the start of the flight only the kid had the wicked cough.  At the end of the flight everyone seated around the kid had the same cough.  I no longer choose my seat in the back of the plane.",
      "When I was travelling from Singapore to Toronto, I took South China Airlines. It had a transit in Guangzhou and the first leg of the trip was absolute chaos. The seats were pretty cramped to begin with and an hour into the flight, a 7/8 year old kid had pooped on the floor in the row behind me. The worst part was that they just left the poop there and the poor flight attendant had to clean it up. She poured some sort of chlorine powder on it but it did little to remove the smell. So I basically had to bear with the horrible smell for the entire 8 hour plane ride - barely ate anything because I felt like throwing up",
      "We had the same experience flying back from Canary islands. The grandma next to me coughed all the way untill Gatwick and her eyes were blood shot..Guess who got Covid immediately after and still has not fully regained my strength.  Worst flight ever!",
      " I recently flew from Paris to Calgary and buddy next to me spent the entire 9 hours coughing. Mostly into his hand but occasionally just rawdogging it directly into the air. Two days later I got strep throat. I wish I pushed him out of the emergency exit.",
      "I took a sleeper bus from Ha Giang back to Hanoi and settle into my cabin. Throughout the journey there were several stops,to pick up more passengers and packages to be sent along the way. Middle of the night I hear snoring **RIGHT NEXT TO ME** and I pull back the curtains and see a sleeping man lying down on the floor of the bus sleeping next to my cabin and the person directly across from me. \n\nI just close the curtains and thank the stars my headphones had a bit of noise cancelling. Fun trip though!",
      "I had an ogre of a Disney adult still wearing her Mickey Mouse shirt who could barely breathe sitting next to my wife and I. She aas so disgusting. I could judt smell the gross bacteria on her and I couldn't wait to have her gone from my vicinity.",
      "I once had an experience on an Amtrak private bedroom where I could hear loud consistent coughing coming from the room next door. The two rooms were connected by a door, and the sound traveled right through. It was incredibly frustrating!",
      "You should have turned around and said, \"can I offer you a mint?\"",
      "I always pack cough drops when flying. I may end up being the cougher, but have passed them out on several occasions to others.",
      "That happened to me on a flight from Miami to Costa Rica at the very start of the pandemic.  The older man in the middle seat coughed about every 2-3 minutes for 3+ hours.   About 4 days later I got sick with a low grade fever, etc.  Months later I wondered if I actually had a mild case of Covid.  I\u2019ve been around people who came down with Covid immediately after and never got it.  I\u2019ve also had all of the shots.   Almost everyone I know has had Covid despite being vaccinated.",
      "FWIW, I had undiagnosed acid reflux and a hiatal hernia, and the result was frequent coughing, which seemed to get worse on airplanes. This was before COVID. I've since had Nissen fundoplication surgery and travel with Chloroseptic MAX lozenges (a Godsend). Benzonotate is also helpful. Just pointing out that many coughers are not contagious, although I understand the concern. I rarely cough these days.",
      "13-hour flight from Tokyo to NYC had very young parents with a screaming baby the ENTIRE flight that could not have even been a year old. Why those parents even brought an infant on a flight that long I'll never know...",
      "Allergy. I need to take at least one antiallergy pill each flight (two are better). I don't cough though, I sneeze and my nose is runny, like two hundred paper tissues runny.",
      "Poor guy - i'm sure coughing for hours straight was miserable.\n\nthis is why i wear a mask on flights and carry my noise cancelling headphones. i'm not dealing with covid uncle.",
      "I find the air in planes to be sooo dry. It dries my skin out so bad when I fly. My lips instantly become chapped, my nose dries up and gets congested. I could see how flying would potentially make someone cough if it did what it does to me and dried out their throat. I drink a ton of water before and during my flight to try and compensate for what I\u2019ll go through during that time and also keep cough drops incase I get a throat tickle. But I\u2019ve never coughed during an entire flight lol",
      "I hope you put on a mask.",
      "this is why I will never again fly or catch a bus without wearing an FFP2/N95",
      "Just about 2 weeks ago, I was on a flight next to 3 men in a row, all in the center aisle while I was on the side row, and they were\u00a0all coughing non stop and refusing to wear a mask or even cover their mouths when they coughed. It was a 10 hour flight. Pretty much next day I had a sore throat, running nose and cough myself. Thanks, assholes.",
      "Honest question here, doesn't it get tiresome of not having direct flights to and from your country to different countries in the world; I assume most of the flights you'd take from pakistan are through the gulf.",
      "How did you know it\u2019s an uncle?",
      "How do you know he was an uncle?",
      "I caught the worst case of covid from some coughing \u201cauntie\u201d sitting 3 seats over from me on a 9 hour flight.  She coughed her brains out the entire time and even though I had an n95 mask in my carry on I didn\u2019t bother putting it on.  That was the absolute last time I flew without the biggest ugliest aids-grade n95 mask proudly strapped to my face.  \n\nOn a side note.. Americans don\u2019t seem to care if you wear a mask but holy crap Germans practically lose their minds with the comments and dirty looks (not that I give a shit). Next time I fly it\u2019s n95 and maga hat for the entire flight!",

      "Since COVID, I bring an N95 with me on flights and if I hear someone nearby coughing/sneezing I wear it. I have had to wear it on basically *every* flight I've taken the last four years because without fail - there is always someone coughing up a storm in my immediate vicinity. I got COVID for the first time this year after forgetting my mask and - wouldn't you know it - sitting right next to a woman on a four-hour flight who was coughing non-stop the whole time, so I learned my lesson to remember it/wear it.\n\nI was coming back on a flight yesterday from HNL and the number of sick people around me was off-the-richter. I swear to god the number of people I hear around me coughing, sneezing, slurping mucus etc. is way higher than it was pre-COVID, even after factoring in that I'm probably noticing it more than I used to.\n\nThe grossest part is the sick people are never wearing masks, and moreso they don't even TRY to stifle their coughs and sneezes - just full-on rawdogging their cold, flu and vid viruses into the cabin.\n\nSo yes: wear an N95 on flights. No one wants to be sick right at the start of their vacation.",

He didn't notice I woke up, so I closed my eyes and made a movement to turn my legs to the other side. He shot his hand away. I pretended to sleep another hour (but I didn't obviously). He luckily didn't touch me again, but when I \"woke\" up later (when I heard other people awake), he asked me if I was asleep the whole time. I said \"yea I really knocked out.\" I said I needed to go to the bathroom, meaning I needed him to get up. He asked me if I wanted him to come with me.

Like close to 400 lbs. There was a tiny woman in the window seat, and she was trapped there for the duration. My man got a seatbelt extender and settled in. He was very nice, and apologetic, too. I\u2019m 6\u20193\u201d, 195 lbs, so I was not going to fit it the seat next to him. But since the flight was sold out, the flight attendants came up with the solution of me sitting semi-sideways, at an awkward angle, with my back to my seatmate, and my legs jutting out into the aisle, but curled against the side of the seat in front of me, so I shaped like a gawky S. I looked ridiculous and it was wildly uncomfortable. And everyone who had to walk by me to use the lavatory stifled a laugh as they passed. It was humiliating.

I\u2019m a victim of previous SA so I believe I blocked this out of my memory until I read another commenter saying the same ... Sigh.",
      "Just this month:\nYYZ to HKG - middle seat next to an insane old woman. She stared at me most of the flight. Also greeted me with a bow and Ni Hao! when I said hello to her (she's white, I'm east Asian). While the plane was getting ready to take off, she told me to get off my phone or it'll be my fault if we end up in the ocean (my phone was already on airplane mode as I explained to her). She then got up from her seat while the plane was ascending. After dinner service, she proceeded to scream at everyone to go to sleep. She got up and started turning people's monitors off and yelling at children to sleep. She also made questionable racial remarks the entirety of the flight. \n\nHKG to YYZ - Seemingly half the flight had a disgusting cough, no masks on these people, just open mouth coughing the entire flight. I'm now down with a bacterial infection (with a cough worse than bronchitis) despite wearing a mask during the whole flight. Go figure.",
      "Approx flight times. 6 hours from NYC to LA. Then 12 hours from LA to Sydney. I started to feel sick on the way to the airport. By the time I got on the plane I had a raging fever, deep muscle aches and was freezing cold.  Every minute felt like an hour.",
      "I had a migraine on a flight from Dubai to Melbourne. It lasted 10 hours.",
      "Found out my grandma died RIGHT before my 10 hour international flight took off\n\nInteresting note; my other grandma had died a week earlier. I exited the plane without grandparents",
      "I was on a 16-hour flight, on my period, and had the middle seat. It was the absolute worst.",
      "8 hours of constant light and moderate turbulence from Keflavik to LAX. I\u2019m deathly terrified of turbulence and was raw dogging the flight on a budget airline. \n\nNot sure if it counts but on a flight from Vegas to Boston a guy died on my flight. People were trying so hard to revive him even though he had been dead for a few hours. We had to divert temporarily to Buffalo which felt like a rollercoaster as we descended at a fast rate and quite the steep angle.",
      "Business class back from GRU with my ex. Turns out I had a 104 fever and pneumonia. I was literally out of it. But I thought i dreamt that the MMA roided up dude across from me, lost his shit, rioted on airplane, and caused a big scene. \n\nTurns out he did. The pilot really was standing over me, debating a midair diversion to northern South America while they restrained him forcefully in his seat. Instead police arrived and arrested him on landing in MIA, the plane was taken out of service with a lay flat biz seat ripped in literal half by his bare hands and i got on some extreme drug cocktails to overcome some Amazonian infection.\n\nI realize said guy could have ripped my head off, and i wouldn't have known...whole flight crew was shocked i didnt wake up during his rampage",
      "I got food poisoning. I was flying from Kuwait to Toronto. As we were landing in Dubai for a lay over I started throwing up. I went straight to the pharmacy in the airport and bought anti diarrhea  pills because shitting myself on a flight is my worst nightmare. With about 7 hours left on the flight to Toronto I found myself looking in the mirror in the bathroom giving myself a pep talk. You can do this. You\u2019ll get through it. I had to get up at least 20 times to throw up.",
      "Emirates A380 from LAX to Dubai. Was in the back, lower level economy section. Something busted loose and was leaking water from the ceiling onto the seats below. Overhead bins were filling up, flight crew was packing towels everywhere, and water (that we hoped was clean) just kept coming. Luckily, my seat was on the edge of the flood zone, so I was only indirectly effected, but it royally sucked for those who were in the splash zone.\n\nFull enough flight that they couldn\u2019t move the people out of the splash zone. Maybe the first class passengers upstairs had to forego their showers on that flight?",
      "15ish hours AUH - YYZ. An old woman seated in the row behind me was looking quite rough from the start of the flight and was making strange gurgling noises on and off for a few hours. About 9 hours in, a bunch of FAs gather around and next thing I know, they\u2019ve laid her out in the aisle next to me and were calling for a doctor. \n\nThey couldn\u2019t revive her and she died. The plane was packed so they left her there, covered in a sheet for the remainder of the flight. Right next to my seat.",
      "Parent of child who screamed whole flight. Believe me. Nobody wanted to open the door more than the parents.",
      "Severe turbulence that caused a flight attendant to break her ankle",
      "It was a 15hr flight and I had very bad motion sickness. Was throwing up just by the smell of the food. I just wanted to sleep but a flight attendant thought it would be nice to treat me to some ice cream from business class. I ate it and threw up even more. Worst experience ever.",
      "Got the stomach flu half way between Paris and Detroit. Detroit was a layover. Still don\u2019t know why they let me get on the next flight, but the flight attendants took care of me like a sick child from Detroit to home. I had called my parents in Detroit and asked them to meet me at security, because even at 25 years old, all I wanted was my mommy. (Really wish my direct flight the day before hadn\u2019t been cancelled! My luggage stayed in Paris an extra week)",
      "Europe to US flight full of a cheerleading team that took up most of economy that all got food poisoning at the same time. Vomit everywhere.",
      "I shit my pants and the then the service dog sitting next to me wouldn\u2019t leave me alone. No cap.",
      "I got placed on the very last row of the plane. Fine. A girl comes sits down with her Chinese food - it was enough for at least 2 people. She whoofs it all down before the doors close. Fine. She then proceeds to flag the flight attendant and says \"I get really bad air sickness can I get some extra puke bags.\"  She made it 30 minutes in. Not fine.",
      "My girlfriend threw up in both of our air sickness bags, one bag sprung a leak and I had to catch the vomit coming out as I ran to find a trash can. She then spent the rest of the flight retching in the bathroom and sitting in the flight attendant's seat in the galley. This was an 11 hour flight from London to Los Angeles. It was bad for me, must have been a lot worse for her.",
      "Woke up on a flight, stretched my legs, and got a terrible leg cramp. Tried to be calm and cool and walk it off with a trip to the bathroom, no luck. Walking back to my seat and I missed my row. Soon I realized I was at the front of the plane, then the anxiety hit, I started to get lightheaded, things went gray and fuzzy, I turned around and passed out in the aisle hitting the seats on my way down. Last thing I saw was the stewardess racing down the aisle toward me. Got off the plane with several face bruises. Close second was when our plane lost an engine over the middle of the Gulf of Mexico and diverted to New Orleans.",
      "Flight from San Jose Costa Rica to JFK. Flight was fine, I was in an aisle seat. When we were disembarking, a guy opened the bin above me and pulled out his bag. I got COVERED in sand and it got in my eyes and almost screamed. He said \u2018it\u2019s just sand\u2019. No apology. Took a few minutes to get out of my eyes. Fuck that guy.",
      "Bit dark, but worse than any turbulence or bad tummy.\n\n\nOn a flight from UK to Nepal for a solo trekking trip I snuggled under my blanket and fell asleep. Woke up to the strange man next to me groping my crotch and thigh under my blanket.\u00a0\n\n\nI firmly moved his hand, yelled at him and to fuck off, called the flight attendant and told them what happened.\u00a0\n\n\nThey did nothing and I had to sit next to him for another 3 hours.\u00a0",
      "Flew right into a bad storm on the way to Taiwan from the USA.  I was on a 747 and I\u2019ve never seen the wings of a plane flex so much.  Bins were falling open.  People were crying, a flight attendant was injured.  The engines were absolutely roaring, and we would just drop hundreds of feet at a time. The lighting was intense.  I was just trying to pound beer for my nerves, and I could barely do that without spilling it everywhere.\n\nMost terrifying thing I\u2019ve ever experienced.  This was about 15 years ago.  I\u2019ve made those flight once or twice a year since without incident",
      "My first cross Atlantic flight was overnight from New York to Frankfurt. It was already a super long day, and I was stressed because flying gave me huge anxiety back then so an international flight just about had me hyperventilating. \n\nI had an aisle seat with an older couple (70s) sitting across from me. I was 28 at the time. They were nice enough, but the woman would simply not. stop. talking to me. I took enough Tylenol PM to kill a moose just before boarding so I could sleep the whole flight. But, alas, it was not to be. She kept me awake the entire flight talking about god knows what because I was too much of a tired, drugged up ball of anxiety to pay attention. She just kept yammering though. Even putting headphones on didn't work.\n\nShe actually commented on how it was such a nice flight when we landed. \n\nThat sleepless night turned into running through the airport for our next flight to Madrid which then turned into a full day guided walking tour of the city. \n\nI don't think I've ever crashed so hard as I did that night.",
      "I\u2019d take a crying baby for 10 hours over flying 3-4 hours with a sinus infection any ol\u2019 day. \u00a0It was torture, then I made it forty times worse by taking a Sudafed (the hardcore ones). \u00a0Then, a couple of hours later, I took another one. \u00a0So I felt like my ear was going to explode and my heart, too. \u00a0I\u2019ll never touch Sudafed again. \u00a0And live in terror of the sinus infection on the plane thing.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Bring on the babies!",
      "YYZ TO LHR this lady and her husband. I have the far aisle seat and her husband has opposite side. One open seat. We had 4 row seats and there was 3 of us. She was on the heavier side and was spilling into my seat. There was literally an open seat this entire 8 hour fight. She decides to sit next to me for 7 and half hours. She was laying on me too like what\u2026 such an odd experience you\u2019d rather sit next to a stranger instead of your significant other.",
      "Doha to LA, so 16 hours, family behind me included a developmentally challenged teen. Dad had to change her diaper in the seat multiple times over the flight, banging into my seat constantly while doing so, so I could never just fall asleep, and of course I really couldn\u2019t say or do anything because\u2026it\u2019s gotta be hell for them.",
      "I just came back from Japan. The chic next to me was literally trying to convert me to Christianity on a 14 hr flight.",
      "Not me but the guy next to me. I passed the fuck out like two minutes into my flight between Singapore and Tokyo. I woke up with my head resting on his shoulder. I profusely apologized to him and he profusely apologized to me. I tried to buy him a beer but he noped the fuck out first chance he got. Sorry little Japanese dude!",
      "A man died on a flight from LAX to SYD. Quietly and of natural causes. We had to make an emergency landing in Fiji for some reason but passengers were not allowed off the plane. They opened doors and encouraged us to take turns looking at the scenery. After a few hours, we refueled and continued on to Sydney. I missed my transfer, of course.",
      "I once sat next to a lady who took up her seat and half of mine. She and I had a arm rest 'fight'(I lost) and she raised the arm rest which allowed her to sit on me. There wasn't another sit to move to. We were in a row that had seats sitting backwards and directly in front of others, some bulk head or emergency exit. It wasn't too long of a flight, Missouri to Denver, but my entire left leg had gone to sleep and was drenched in sweat by the end of it. No one spoke the entire flight, the people across from me didn't say anything UNTIL we landed. \n\nWhich is when the oh so very heavy lady turned to the man ACROSS from her, and called him \"honey\" ...and I've never turned my head around so fast in my life... he let his wife sit on me and didn't once offer to switch places. \n\nI've never been so upset and hurt after a plane trip in my life.  Literally, my leg was asleep from being sat on for around 3 hours and my jeans were soaked. I peeled my jeans off my leg, it was so wet, I kid you NOT. Also,  I'd been sitting at an angle to avoid being directly and fully sat on...so my spine alignment was off...so limped off the plane. \nTo this day, I hate that dude, I hope he is still married to her and gets rolled over on nightly.",
      "Hour and a half holding pattern after six hours of flying international back to the U.S. Eventually had to divert bc of risk of fuel starvation. My poor friend had food poisoning for the entire flight.",
      "It was a flight from LA to New Zealand. I was stuck on the very last row, middle seat, right next to the toilets in a seat that didn't recline and had a broken screen. They also ran out of chicken.\n\n\nThankfully that was my first international flight and it got much better after",
      "Bad ear infection while flying from Sacramento or San Francisco to Chicago. I have a high pain tolerance and it hurts more than anything. I just sat in my seat, eyes closed, trying not to move.\u00a0\n\n\nI've broken bones, had gout attacks, been beaten and left for dead twice, sinus surgery where the after surgery morphine didn't help. Nothing was as bad as that.\u00a0",
      "I'm American but lived in China for some years, one year was flying China Eastern Airlines back home to the East Coast for the holidays. \n\n~14 hr flight Shanghai to NY, and that janky ass airline only had a couple English-speaking flight attendants. One attendant overheard me chatting in Mandarin with my seatmate (I'm white but my Mandarin was pretty good at the time) and asked me to help translate for some of the American passengers.\n\nTurned into me doing that dozens of times for the whole flight, I barely slept and was so pissed off at the airline I never flew it again",
      "Not a flight, but a 27-hour Amtrak journey from the PNW to LA. \n\nI\u2019m an hour into the journey when my mom calls me. She\u2019s frantic - my dad had a severe bowel obstruction and she was told she had five minutes to give consent for his colon to be removed, or he would die. So she called me. \n\nI\u2019m like, what the absolute fuck? I\u2019m on a train headed to LA, and I\u2019m about to lose service for the next 12 hours of my journey, and by the time my phone is connected again my dad will, at best, live the rest of his life with an ostomy bag. \n\nTo top it all off, Amtrak hadn\u2019t reinstated the dining service yet after COVID, and I had decided to use this trip as a chance to quit vaping. I also didn\u2019t bring any edibles like I usually would, because the friend I was going to stay with asked me not to because of her curious pets. \n\nSo picture it - you\u2019ve got 26 hours ahead of you on the rails, there\u2019s no easy way home *or* to the Midwest where your family is, you\u2019ve got no service for updates about the situation, you can\u2019t get a regular meal, oh - and you conveniently decided not to bring any vices with you that would help you calm down and sleep. \n\nBonus points, I got EXTREMELY constipated and suffered so badly in the Amtrak bathroom that a staff member had to ask if I was okay. Luckily, I was in Business class so I had a little extra breathing room to take up a stall for two hours. \n\nWorst day of my life. Well, until my dad actually passed away a few months ago, but even that wasn\u2019t as much of a Twilight Zone experience as that Amtrak ride.",
      "Red eye from IST - CPT. Sat Next to a woman whose phone alarm would go off like every 30 min for some reason. At one point, she went to the bathroom and it started going off, my husband to had reach into her purse to shut it off because it was driving us nuts and she was nowhere in sight. I also had to sit in a bassinet seat. For 10 fucking hours.",
      "Flew business back from the Maldives last month. Lovely peaceful holiday until I set foot on the plane. We also had a screaming baby five rows back that screamed the entire flight. They didn\u2019t walk it up and down or anything. Just let it cry whilst they drunk alcohol",
      "Red eye flight from SFO to Dulles for a wedding. Planned on eating a weed brownie and sleep. The packaging said something like \u201c1/4 dose\u201d or something. I read it as the whole edible was just a quarter dose so I ate the whole thing. What the label meant was only eat 1/4 of the brownie for one dose. I fell asleep but woke up super nauseous, sweating, and way too high. Felt like my heart was going to explode. Puked a few times on the way there. Luckily most everyone was asleep so there was no line for the bathroom. Longest 6 hour flight of my life.",
      "I was 30 weeks pregnant, traveling across country (WA to FL) to see my grandparents with my 20 month old toddler, without my husband \ud83d\ude05 flight was as fine as fine can be with a busy toddler. Until about 4 hours in, when they said there was a bad storm in Tampa and we\u2019d have to circle around until it passed. Fast forward to circling, they say we\u2019re running low on gas and need to go to Orlando to fill up. Well, all the other planes from Tampa did too! We waited for another hour to get gas, the. another hour to fill up\u2026 all the while we weren\u2019t allowed off the plane. They ran out of drinks and food. It was miserable. We finally got into Tampa 9.5 hours after we left Seattle. I silently cried as much as my toddler did, to be honest. It was brutal.",
      "It wasn\u2019t necessarily long but I\u2019ll just say I will never fly on Black Friday again. That was the worst smelling plane ride of my life and the lavatory was a carousel. I was very unfortunately seated second to last row. Never, ever again. I fly home tomorrow. Wish me better luck Reddit.",
      "Both occured on my recent trip\n\n1) Dubai - London\nTwo babies screaming and crying the entire journey, guy snoring so loudly that the entire section can hear. Two landing attempts due to strong winds. When we finally landed we had to remain in our seats further to let emergency services attend to a few passengers who threw up when the plane pulled back up suddenly. I honestly just wanted to get out already as I was starting to feel sick myself.\n\n2) London - Dubai -Singapore\nFlew while having a UTI. Was in pain the entire journey.",
      "The guy sitting beside me had diarrhoea all over himself, literally EVERYWHERE, and there were no other seats for me to move to.  I flew for 8??? hours with shit smeared all the fuck over the plane and all over the seat next to me.",
      "I got sick on my connecting flight in Paris to DC flying back from a wedding in Belgrade. At first I thought I was just hung over. Then I thought they had the air conditioning up too high. Then I started to feel sick and made it to the toilet as stuff came out both ends. I was honestly sicker than I had ever been in my entire life. I called over the flight attendant who refused to believe I was sick. He insinuated that I was just stressed from traveling alone. Then he suggested I was just drunk. Then he told me I couldn\u2019t have food poisoning because I hadn\u2019t been traveling in Africa. Then finally he decided I was hysterical and that I needed oxygen. He got angry that I wasn\u2019t responding to any of his helpful suggestions. I then blacked out, a different flight attendant realized I had a fever when trying to revive me, and I spent the rest of the flight wrapped in blankets in the back galley. They called for a wheelchair to take me off, but not before the same flight attendant who refused to believe I was sick leaned down and asked if it was possible I was just pregnant. \n\nTurns out I had campylobacter and was sick for about two weeks.\n\nThe other worst fight was Air India from Mumbai to Hong Kong. It was an overnight flight that stopped in Delhi to pick up more people and was part of a 32 hour journey I was making with stop overs in Hong Kong and Beijing to get to Ulaanbaatar. So, I was very focused on trying to sleep on the plane, but it was incredibly noisy. Like, people playing music on their phones loudly, nonstop getting up and down from seats, etc. Then there was the mango nectar. I swear to god, every 15-20 minutes a flight attendant would come down the aisle, jostle me awake, and say \u201cmango nectar?\u201d I\u2019d take the carton of mango nectar and try to go back to sleep for it to happen again. Finally I had accumulated like, four cartons of the stuff and I was tired of being shaken awake to be handed more fucking mango nectar and I shouted at one of the flight attendants to leave me alone and not to wake me up again. \n\nThe last worst flight was London to Tel Aviv. It was right before Chanukah and there were a lot of Ultra Orthodox passengers. To make matters worse, it was a budget carrier with no assigned seats. We ended up taking off two hours late because the flight attendants couldn\u2019t get people to stay in their seats. No one wanted to sit next to an unrelated person of the opposite sex, which resulted in rounds of musical chairs. Of course not everyone could be accommodated, so there were a few men just standing there refusing to sit down. Then there were waves of people getting up to pray. Then there were people taking their children to the bathroom or getting things out of overhead cabinets. The flight attendants were literally begging people to sit down. The pilot came on at some point and basically said that we are leaving late because no one will sit down and remain in their seats, and asked everyone to please stop getting up and to take their seats. \n\nFinally, everyone sat down and we started taxiing. Right then someone\u2019s cell phone rang, and the ultra orthodox guy sitting behind me answered his phone, got up from his seat, walked up to the stewardess who was sitting in the jump seat because we were moments from taking off, and asked her if it was possible for him to step off of the plane for a minute to take an important call. The look the stewardess gave him was like she wanted to straight up murder him. And finally, after two hours of British politeness dealing with a bunch of feral passengers, she shouted \u201cARE YOU MAD?! TURN OFF YOUR BLOODY PHONE, SIT IN YOUR SEAT, AND DON\u2019T GET UP AGAIN!!!!!\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve been in a few flights to Tel Aviv in my life, but that one was by far the most chaotic.",
      "Tied between the time a 3 year old overdosed on goldfish crackers and puked them up (he was window, I was aisle) on a 6h trip, and a raging cold that started as I got to the airport and accelerated the entire 8h flight: dripping nose and raw throat. I had a mask but I was freaking miserable",
      "That makes me more sad for the parents and baby than for other passengers. Probably because I have no problems tuning out crying babies. \n\nMy worst flight wasn\u2019t that long but it was a flight from Indy to Denver with my dad, who had been diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s and that trip is when I realized he had progressed much further than we had previously realized.",
      "I didn't get up to move enough and my feet swelled up inside my boots. I couldn't walk off the plane. Another time I went to the bathroom in socks. Both hard lessons to learn",
      "A kid in the seat behind us was projectile vomiting for six hours on a flight from Paris to Los Angeles. His neighbors were moved and the flight attendants really tried cleaning it all up and covering the smell with coffee grinds. Somewhere around the Midwest, he started feeling weak so they did the whole \"doctor on board\" thing, which was chaos right beside us.",
      "I had an old lady in front of me fart for 8 straight hours coming back from London.",
      "I had one international flight where a passenger decided to squat on the toilet seat... full on feet on the seat squat. They had pretty bad aim and got shit all over the seat and on the floor. Their attempt to clean themselves was even worse. Instead of flushing the toilet paper, they threw it in the thrash bin next to the sink. There was shit all over the flap of that bin. I flagged down a flight attendant to let them know. She opened the door and  had a look. She immediately closed the door and gave me a look of disgust, but also, like she's seen worse. It was tagged out for the rest of the flight.",

      "LAX to PHL window seat, and aisle seat was a (truly) handicapped person who needed help to get up.   I had to pee so bad.   I always choose aisle now.  \n\nIAH to AKL on ANZ - direct. Crying baby.  \n\nFRA to PHL - FA spilled spaghetti on me.  \n\nProbably the 1st one was worst.",
      "VS Upper Class LAX to LHR when the configuration was seats facing each other across the aisle. Very troubled actor across from me, swearing, punching himself in the face, tore his tshirt apart, etc. Cabin crew did nothing. I spent a lot of time hanging out at the bar trying not to look or make eye contact.",
      "This was towards the end of lockdowns and my lab had a conference in France. For some reason our company travel group booked me near the window and my coworker at the aisle. So there was this older wide (not fat, just round) dude with a lady bug kids backpack and a laptop bag in the middle. Because he couldn't close his legs from being round and having luggage under the seat, he would manspread into both of our seats. He then would reach down to grab packs of peanuts and inhale them. He would start coughing from choking, yet still pop more peanuts in his mouth. I think we were more confused than uncomfortable though.",
      "The child in the seat in front of me spilled his milk and cereal directly into my brand new purse. He and his mom said nothing while I called over the flight attendant and used a pile of napkins to suck the milk and Cheerios out of my brand new leather handbag. At the end of the flight when we stood up he broke down crying and apologized to me. The poor kid was probably stressed the whole flight about it",
      "Nonstop on Norwegian air from Paris to Washington, D.C. A kid was kicking my seat, and there was less than the usual amount of leg room. I\u2019m only 5\u20195 and I hurt after this flight. \n\nThe flight attendants came by with meal service. A lady tried to ask for a coke, and the flight attendant said, \"This is only for the people who ordered it.\" I thought that meant they would come by later with drink service for the rest of us plebes. Nope! They didn't even offer us water for the entirety of an 8 hour transatlantic flight...\n\nI avoid Norwegian flights like the plague after having experienced this torture trip.",

I\u2019m now 40 and have flown on many many long haul flights. That was my worst.",
      "Someone was being deported. Of course I had no idea and they assigned me a seat besides the prisoner and the policemen. No one else around. Prisoner rebelled upon departing and attacked them and I was southing like a mad woman to call the attention and abort departing. Was able to do so. Police came they took them to land and we departed again when the personnel cleaned the blood. \nI asked for something to calm me down and they gave me tea.",
      "I had a panic/anxiety attack flying to Ireland. We were mid flight and my daughter was sleeping on me when all of a sudden I felt like I couldn\u2019t breathe. I got up to go to the bathroom and almost blacked out and ended up laying on the galley floor for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, I told the flight attendant that I was having a panic attack and she told me that it wasn\u2019t that and I\u2019d be flailing around if it were that. It quickly passed and I was ok but terrifying. Odd thing about it is that I fly all the time for work and grew up flying (including overseas) as my mom worked for an airline, and something like this had never happened.",
      "Auckland to NYC. We had HORRIFIC turbulence over the pacific. Whole plane wore their dinner and the galley carts that weren\u2019t secured spilled everywhere. Couple folks who weren\u2019t buckled at the time got air and at least a couple banged their heads on the ceiling. Pilot came over the PA asking folks to make sure they\u2019re buckled TIGHTLY. We heard the FAs chatting after the flight that it was the worst they had ever experienced. \n\nAnd then in the middle of that all, my partner started having a moderate-to-severe allergic reaction (we suspect nut cross contamination). Pounded benedryll and had epi pen in hand, but we were hours from any airport in the middle of the pacific. He\u2019s alright, but that was a top 5 scariest moment ever.",
      "Atlanta to Amsterdam earlier this year. I was an idiot and took half a Xanax, melatonin gummy, and had two glasses of wine. I woke up in a sweaty delirium mid flight and went to the bathroom because I panicked and thought I was going to vomit and ended up almost passing out in the bathroom. My wife and a flight attendant found me when it took me awhile to come back. I'd never felt like that before. I was in a cold sweat, felt the weirdest combination of not drunk, not high, but severely nauseous and confused. I begged the flight attendant to let me sleep on the floor in the galley which of course she said no to. They gave me some water and cookies while I sat shivering on the closed toilet. Finally I was able to get up and I curled up in my seat and was miserable the rest of the flight. By the time our layover in Amsterdam was done the delirium was gone but I felt full body exhaustion. My wife was soooooo pissed at me.\n\n\nI typically take Xanax before a flight and sometimes have a drink but the melatonin was a new addition. A bad one.",
      "Just to point out from personal experience that masking and adding scents to smell to cover up a passengers stink is only half the battle.  I\u2019ve been next to ones that literally caused my eyes to water.  \n\nTwo experiences for me.  Returning from Japan to SFO.  Over Pacific Ocean. Nowhere to divert to and too far to turn around\u2026. young guy about 40 decides it\u2019s the perfect time to pass a kidney stone.   God, the yelling and screaming that went on.  Even noise cancelling headphones didn\u2019t work well. \n\nSecond one - old guy that set next to me from Atlanta to London looked like a 30 year old future version of myself.  It was uncanny.  He had middle seat. I had window.  I went to sleep. Woke up by FA informing me that they were having a \u201csituation\u201d with my father and needed my help getting him out of the bathroom.  He had a couple drinks and was tipsy.   Went into the bathroom and fell on the floor pressed against the door and it couldn\u2019t be opened.  They had to take the door off to get it out of the frame to open.   Put him back in his seat and gave me a stern talking to in a loud voice for allowing him to travel  like that.  Despite my claims I didn\u2019t know him.  Finally came back and uttered a super quiet apology for the mix up. Arrived in London and during descent rolled forward and into the mans next to him (aisle seat) lap/legs.   He had died.  Entire plane was held up while they used the AED and then when that failed to deliver a shock (it won\u2019t work if there is no point) waited for MedLink to send a doctor to declare him dead and then had to call and remove the body.  The aisle seat guy and myself were moved down the aisle to stand in the aisle while this was going on and the \u201cvery sick passenger\u201d was being removed. Meanwhile everyone that heard that loud talking to I got but not the super quiet apology was shooting my eye daggers and murmuring how inconsiderate and careless I was and how people were going to miss their connecting flight.  Now imagine when we finally got off and I simply walked away how uncaring I appeared.  \nThere were some passengers staying at the hotel in Marblearch where I was that would glare at me every time our paths crossed.",

No crying at all and slept the majority of the 10 hour flight. Was amazed at my luck, as this was my first long haul flight with either of my kids.\n\nBut there was another baby right next to us, and he was just like what you described lol. Not only did he cry the whole time, but his cry was very\u2026 unique. Like a hoarse screeching sound, unlike anything I\u2019ve heard from a baby before lol. And his crying kept waking up my child, so every hour or so I\u2019d have to rock her back to sleep.

I don\u2019t know how long this syndicate did this but the corruption was enough to bring this airline to decline and ultimately out of business. In my case, the ruse was a flight attendant took my carry-on because supposedly the overhead bins were full and she would stow it somewhere else. Upon landing, she claimed not interacting with me when I asked where my carry-on was. There was nothing I could do since everyone had to deplane and was told to go to lost and found.

They wanted to read all night and had their overhead lights going, but there was an issue with the lights and they were turning off and on every 2-3 seconds or so.  It made it impossible for us to sleep seated across the row from them.  They apparently didn't give a rat's ass about anyone else in their area.  Another one was on a flight from Chicago to Montreal.  Not a long haul, but someone evidently stole a video camera from a passenger who had it somewhere on the floor around their seat.

He asked lots of weird questions of the flight attendants , kept getting up to do nothing, and was overall the creepiest person I\u2019ve ever seen on a flight. I wasn\u2019t sure how he was going to accomplish it, but I was pretty convinced for the whole 9 hours that he was gonna try to bring the plane down somehow.",
      "On a flight from Doha to Bangkok with some walker bound 80 year old guy and his 18 year old Thai wife/girlfriend and him constantly getting up and me having to get up too and stand for a while because he shook more than a dog pooping razor blades trying to stand to go to the bathroom. \u00a0I think the guy had a serious case of screaming meemees but to this day idk why he didn\u2019t take the aisle seat and just let me sit in the window seat so I wouldn\u2019t have to keep getting up. \u00a0And seeing them kiss and stuff was definitely the stuff of nightmares and is why I know they were romantically involved. \u00a0This dude had to be almost 90 and she looked younger than me and I was in my early 20\u2019s. \u00a0If I were a celebrity I would\u2019ve sworn I was being Punked but nope, just had a shitty (literally) flight. \u00a0The guy stank too, there\u2019s no way he was getting completely clean. \u00a0The smell could\u2019ve gagged a maggot. \u00a0It was the \u201cWTF\u201d singularity. \u00a0I think I would\u2019ve been more comfortable in the wheel well than sitting (well standing half the time from the amount of times this guy got up) aisle next to a walker bound old guy constantly shitting and then frenching his girlfriend who was young enough to be his great granddaughter. \u00a0I wish I was making this up, I wish even more that I didn\u2019t see this post because it dredged up that terrible memory.",

      "Early 2022, when masks were still mandatory on planes. Guy next to me was high or something. His head would keep falling to my side and he wouldn\u2019t stop pulling his mask up or down, making weird noises while he sort of slept but was awake at the same time somehow. Mind you, this was only a three-and-a-half hour flight, but it felt so much longer. The crew moved me to another seat for the last hour of the flight after repeated complaints from me and then trying to make the guy behave. He was so high that he wouldn\u2019t listen and didn\u2019t seem able to control his actions. They even threatened him with calling the police once we landed but they ended up not doing it. Worst short red eye flight ever.",

      "I had the flu hit me at the worst possible time. I had an 8 hour flight and I was feeling funky when I woke up, nothing to stop me though, just mild stomach stuff, I thought I ate something bad. I board the plane at 6:30am, so I didn't even really have time to figure out if I was sick or not, figured I would just poop a lot on the plane. Nope, 20 mins into our flight I'm vomiting my life away, I have a 100+ fever and my body is effectively shutting down. They kept making me go back to my seat due to turbulence and I had to keep throwing up in a little bag while trying not to shit myself. The funny part was, there was an older couple from some Midwest nowhere town and they heard me and my friends were from the \"big city\" they wanted to take photos with us on the plane. I kept saying no, but they wouldn't take no for an answer. There exists a photo of me, 2 elderly people and 3 of my friends and I look green! And my shirt has throw up on it.

      "Flying from Lima to Cusco in Peru, normally a 1.5 hr flight and were leaving at 9am. At 5am that morning, myself and my partner wake up with progressively more violently explosive diarrhoea from questionable tiramisu the night before. \n\nWe get to the airport feat a mouse sized cockroach stowaway in our luggage from accommodation and are on the flight feeling sorry for ourselves and looking forward to getting to destination. For context, Cusco airport is effectively one strip of concrete in a city surrounded by mountains, cloud and heavy winds. The pilot attempts to land twice but the headwinds mean that the plane physically cannot land. At this point I'm sickly pale and rapidly losing all will to live. We make out in our questionable Spanish through the announcements that the plane doesn't have much fuel so we need to land at Arequipa, about 500kms away, to refuel. We get there and the plane sits on the tarmac for 2 hours with passengers around us getting progressively more restless, and then rowdy, and then full on banging their fists on the cockpit door demanding to know what's happening. The police are called and board the flight to calm everyone and escort the rowdy footy lads off the flight.\n\nAnother announcement - we are going back to Lima aka our point of departure, with a \"check your emails we have tried to book you onto other flights but don't guarantee anything\". We land back at Lima and collect our baggage to literally check back in immediately and return to the gate to the second flight. Thankfully, third attempt at Cusco runway is a charm and we touched down at 11pm when we should have arrived at about 11.30am. It's been a slow return to tiramisu since.",

      "8 hour flight from UK to Dubai. I was in the row behind where they put all the babies. There was 5 babies. They tag-teamed crying for the whole flight - always at least 1 going. I wouldn't have minded because I know it's not really the baby's fault, but the in-flight entertainment was broken for a quarter of the plane, so they rebooted it about an hour after we took off (when I'd almost finished a film). The reboot took it out for the other 3/4 of the plane. They tried rebooting a few more times but it didn't come back for the rest of us. So I couldn't even put something on to entertain myself or listen to music or anything. This was before streaming services had phone apps you could download content to. So I sat staring at a broken screen listening to 5 babies screaming for 7 hours. \n\nThe air stewardess at least gave me some earplugs and multiple baileys FOC which was nice.",
      "Had the best and worst long flight experiences on Singapore Airlines coming and going back from Singapore on 13 hour flights.\n\nOn the flight there, I had the best long haul flight ever. Had an empty middle seat so I could lie down. I basically watched Lord of the Rings, ate my food, and fell asleep. Time flew by! A comfortable and enjoyable flight, plus I was excited to land in SE Asia for the first time.\n\nOn the way back, I had the unfortunate luck to come down with a horrible illness three hours before we boarded the plane. Basically, I felt horrifically nauseas but couldn't throw up at all. All I wanted to do was lie down and sleep, which was the one thing I couldn't do. I spent the entire flight unmoving, curled up next to the window, not even having the energy to get up and pee. I couldn't even drink water because the thought of consuming anything made me sick. I remember grabbing a vomit bag and gagging into it, but nothing came out... Rejected both meals, didn't watch any in-flight entertainment, couldn't sleep. All i could do for 13 hours is close my eyes. \n\nYeah I'm pretty sure it was the flu lol. I got home and developed a nasty cold, but luckily got over the nausea pretty quick after a good night's rest.",

He even picked up my empty drink bottle and started playing with it without my knowledge.\n\nThe parents kept telling the cabin crew to just leave him alone and it got to the stage where the cabin crew basically offered to tie him down to his seat.

      "I know I'm late, but I have to share my story. I took my first international flight from Dallas, TX to Rome, Italy when I was 21 years old. I'd had some experience being on short flights at that time but nothing anywhere close to the 9-hour flight on which I was about to embark. I also just had a really hard time sleeping anywhere that wasn't my own bed at the time. I was nervous that I would be awake the entire flight. My new boyfriend at the time (now husband!) told me that he usually took an Ambien on an international flight and it would knock him out and when he woke up he would be at his destination. It sounded great to me, so I got an extra Ambien from him and planned to take it for the flight.\n\nBAD BAD IDEA. I took the Ambien right after we ate dinner on the airplane and all was fine until I went to the bathroom about 20 minutes later. When I came out of the bathroom, it was like I was in a different world. I was seeing all sorts of colors and hallucinations. I saw people with 2 heads. It was crazy. Scared out of my mind, I made my way back to my seat where I was sitting next to a friend (it was a school trip). She could tell something was wrong and before I knew it I was throwing up all over myself, her, and the surrounding area. It was awful. Fortunately I had the wherewithal to pack a change of clothes in my carry on so that saved the day. The flight attendants got the area cleaned up for us and I spent the next \\~7 hours of the flight miserable and I didn't sleep a wink.\n\nLesson learned: don't ever take a new medication for the first time on an airplane. My husband felt terrible at the time when he learned what happened (because of course HE took an Ambien and slept the entire flight!) but we have a really good laugh about it now.",

And the next meal came and it was thesame.  After that, I just made sure that the flight staff knew that I\u2019m a take whatever you have and just give this special boy all the things that he thinks he needs so give him the kosher meal and I will take whatever it is, and I will leave whatever I can of it or want to. Period but honestly, he didn\u2019t make his own reservation. He just thought it would be perfect for him. Please don\u2019t anyone ever mention entitlement and skip over the orthodox boys.",

I saw him at the gate earlier and noticed him because he was wearing this really loud, gaudy yellow and pink silk shirt that made no sense and really baggy, dirty looking jeans. The guy looked off. Anyway, he was the VERY last person to board after the doors had already been closed. I assume security held him back or something. Anyway, as he's coming up with his bag and the flight attendant is trying to find a space for his bag in the overheads, he just smells like really rank BO and heavy, heavy musk cologne/perfume. It was bad. Really bad. My row mate starts sneezing and asks if he can change seats and the flight attendant says the flight is full, sorry.

The airline gave us all food and milk. I spilled my milk (no crying) all over myself, so I figured I was in for a sticky ride later. We all got back on the plane eventually. People started vomiting soon afterwards. Seems that the milk that we were given was off. And it was camel's milk. Since I was wearing my milk, I was fine, but my brother was really ill.",

      "Certainly not nearly as bad as other horror stories, Tokyo-Haneda to MSP. I really do not like flying  to begin with so the anxiety was already high. First I ended up with a seat mate who only two days before when I had checked was not going to be there, and of course he was like the last dude to get on the plane as I had already dropped a bunch of crap into his seat expecting he would not be there. Full flight (which was not the case for my previous MSP-HND flight), there was a screaming child who the parents struggled at times to keep calm. The flight took off in the evening so we were crossing the Pacific in the dark, which started sending my anxiety to dangerous levels especially as I noticed the flight tracker route was adjusted quite a bit south and I started fearing we were off course and I was close to asking the attendants a stupid question about if everything was OK, because the captain's deck was less communicative with the passengers than other flights I had been on.\n\nI only relaxed again when the plane got back over North America (now back in daylight), and then I was able to keep myself together the rest of the flight.",
      "Ended up in a seat next to 2 unaccompanied minors on a 15 hour flight. The 6 year old was a terror - throwing stuff, kicking the chair in front of him the entire time. \n\nEveryone thought it was MY kids, not to mention I couldn\u2019t rest or do anything the whole time. They had a flight attendant who was assigned, but she was also working so she only came to check on them every couple of hours.",

      "15 hours, SF to the Middle East on a united 777.\n\nStupidly long routing because of how difficult the destination was at the time, wasting 9 hours in connections only to fly past my house on the final leg.\n\nThe 15 hour leg was heavily delayed, then when it boarded it was oversold. Last minute business travel booking I had no influence over, had one of the middle seats in economy in the 4 wide section. The person to my right stunk, was coughing, and constantly just doing weird things that would wake you up, and also asked me whether he could put another of his bags under my footwell. No thanks. The person to my left (the other middle seat) brought a full sized pillow and blanket set and proceeded to nap the entire time with so much  stuff that I was constantly having his bedding fall all over me or hit stuff like my food on my tray table. Whenever he woke, he\u2019d ask us to move to go to the bathroom, because the aisle seat to his left was in too deep a sleep (and just a big guy).\n\nThis was also the most unruly and loud flight I\u2019ve ever been on a western airline.\n\nOther bad experiences on a long flight involve obvious things like babies and families spilling their drinks all over me, ever-smelling accidents in the nearby lavatories that lasted the whole flight and shut them down, and finding out through crew and deboarding passenger gossip that my seat on an upcoming 9 hour flight had been just occupied for the previous 6 hours by a now-deceased passenger. Fortunately I got them to change my seat, before they decided after cleaning to instead leave that row unoccupied. Unfortunately I was just sad the whole time because I was still 1 row in front of said seat, and got into my own head about death because I was the 1 person on the flight who listens too much to his surroundings and knew what had just happened. Fairly certain there\u2019s been at least 1 death on a flight I\u2019ve been on, but the crew did a good job at keeping it lowkey out of respect for the passenger, so nobody really knew. I\u2019ve also had to call for medical emergency before for another passenger leading to a heavily delayed flight from the taxiway.\n\nPeople wonder why I try and heavily utilize points/CCs and fly in business class even on my personal travel when possible. I\u2019ve seen some shit, and it\u2019s worth it to basically be in a private world while crossing half the planet.",

The kid started shitting on the toilet seat, then the floor. I was in complete shock, and tried to tell him to stop, but he was laughing his ass off. He started grabbing his shit with his hands, and wiping it over everything, the walls, the sink. I was mortified. Then, my dad banged on the door and demanded I get out. We never spoke about it again.",

Doubly thankful I had paid for an extra legroom seat that included free booze, so he kept the wine coming to try and ease the pain. Absolute longest flight of my life.",

It was tense, chaotic, and smelly. Thankfully the Naoribi travelers picked up on these differences fairly quickly and things settled down an hour or two into the flight.

The flight attendant spoke to the parents several times. The mother who was not allowed to speak (controlled by her husband) sat silent. The father told the attendant men of any age can do whatever they want. The attendant alerted the captain. He gathered the family and had them removed from the plane. They were taken to a room and the rules of flight were explained to them. This kid and the father's reaction made the flight difficult and did not gain the people from this country any fans.",

But he could say like \"It's difficult, etc.\" But I just can't believe the dad was such a pushover and couldn't discipline or entertain his son. Like wander around the plane with the kid to use some of the pent up energy. I didn't get much sleep as a result.\n\nAnd on the way back, a mother, baby, and the grandmother sat 2 rows in front of me on a day flight. The baby literally cried the whole flight. It got so heated the passengers directly behind the baby were arguing with the mom to do a better job of consoling the baby. Even the FA got involved.

This was the happiest I\u2019ve ever been on the connecting SFO-JFK flight (usually miserable) because at least I got to sit in one place for 5 more hours. It took 3 days to wear off.",
      "Was flying from Amsterdam to Minneapolis, got a panic attack for the first time, realizing how far I\u2019m from home, whole flight I was standing near the backside of the plane. Didn\u2019t understand if it was a heart attack at first, every minute felt like a war",
      "Similar to you, OP, my flight from Paris, France to Atlanta last year I had THREE crying babies. One in the row in front of me, the row behind me, and the row to my left. When one stopped, another started, sometimes triggering all three to shriek in unison like a pack of dogs. My partner and I took turns with the one pair of noise blocking headphones to attempt naps. Oh, and the lady to my right had no trouble falling asleep but used me as a pillow for most of the flight as well.",
      "Sitting next to an overweight woman. It wasn't her fault, but the smell and shear space she took made the flight an awful experience.",

      "Flew Malaysian Air from San Francisco to Tokyo. I had bruises on the sides of my legs from the seat being so narrow, the man next to me had powerful BO, and the food was unrecognizable as food\u2014 well, maybe that white packing material was shredded daikon radish. But that gelatinous green square was not fish jello, it was weirder than that.",
      "During the night on a flight to Ireland, a man in the last row had chest pains.  The entire back of the plane started screaming at the top of their lungs.  Coming out of a dead sleep to that was horrifying.  I thought we were being hijacked.  Seriously.  It was indigestion.",
      "Large people don't fit in the lav very well. I worked at an airport and the crews would tell us some stories. Screaming kids and those that play video without headphones. I have been sick on a plane and that is the worst.",
      "Rudeness from Lufthansa staff yelling at me and my seat mate for just about anything they could think of flying into and out of Munich felt like a feature of the flight. It was so weird.\n\nNot my experience, but the lady who\u2019s foot broke as she disembarked the plane probably was her worst experience . Same flight as above, but as she took the last step off the steps onto the tarmac, her foot just twisted round and broke. Strange to see her on the ground with her foot at a > 90\u00b0 to the side.",
      "Flight to NZ from LAX in 2001. I sat in a seat next to the mid cabin exit door with the emergency slide built into the door. The housing for the slide meant that I had to sit in my seat slightly sideways with feet pointing toward the guy in the middle seat who was a basketball player almost 7\u2019 tall. I don\u2019t know how they could sell that seat but I sat in it for 11+ hours. Meal service was a nightmare.",
      "Greece to JFK in an economy middle seat. The seat had a jagged edge that ripped my pants down the side and cut my skin. I had to walk around with a napkin to not flash my underwear. I have Celiac and they didn\u2019t have the gluten free meals that I ordered, so once the few snacks that I had ran out I was starving. We hit turbulence so bad that the plane dropped a few hundred feet in seconds. Bags flew around. And when we landed, it was so rough that a piece of the paneling broke off and hit me on the head and cut me there. And the worst part? They wouldn\u2019t even let me keep the panel as a souvenir.",
      "I just flew back from Rome.  A young woman wiped her whole seat down with the wipe United provided then took her shoes and socks off and put her stinky feet on the seat.  I\u2019m like you gonna wipe it down after?",
      "For me it was an overnight Sao Paolo to Chicago and I got seated in the far back of the plane and the turbulence was terrible for the entire 12 or whatever hours, we could only safely move around for like 45 minutes in total.  It got so bad at one point that people\u2019s drinks in the front rows hit the ceiling and it was raining soda on people.  I can hardly believe everyone was buckled in\u2026.and the flight crew had luckily suspended service.  It was absolutely terrifying and the whole time I was crammed in this horrible space near a non-functioning toilet that smelled like shit.  Last time I flew United.  This was 2012.",

As a gift, I gave him  plane tickets for later that same evening (this was 25 years ago when paper tickets were still a thing).  As soon as the party was over, my brother drove us to the airport ... we were on our way to Vegas, baby!  The bad part about it was that something I ate for dinner gave me the worst gas imaginable.  You know that kind where you can just feel your stomach constantly churning, and the gas bubbles moving throughout your system.  There was no way to hold all that gas in ... and for that I am truly sorry for all the people sitting anywhere near me.",

He was loud and obnoxious singing and shouting at his family. About two hours in he spilt a glass on me. I had to go the rest of the flight smelling like cheap wine listening to everything. When he finally passed out he snored loud enough to shake the seats.",
      "Delta Flight from South Africa to Atlanta with a stop over that no one knew about in San Juan PR for a crew change. The crew did NOT want to be on the flight. They were horrible - threw things at us, purposefully hit us with their carts throughout the flight. They just wanted to get of in PR and get off the flight. How do i know?? They bragged about it the entire flight. The new Crew from San Juan to Atlanta was very nice. Totally different than the horror show we experienced. \n\nIf you\u2019re one of the Crew Members on the flight from\nCPT to San Juan on April 11th 2024 - I hope all the liquor you were hiding in your suitcases broke, ruined all your clothes and belongings.",
      "Had a bad hamburger at the airport of Bangkok. Starting to get more nauseous during the wait for boarding. By the time the airplane took off I puked two bags full. Held it tight, but because of the airpressure they broke both during take off, all over my clothes\u2026 the people around me are getting sick as well. Couldn\u2019t get out of my chair, because of the take off. Had to sid there with puke all over me waiting for the seatbelt sign to get off. That was a long 10 minutes. After that i went to the toilet, took my clothes off and wash them in the little sink. Had to sid for 10 hours in wet, smelly clothes and every 10 minutes I had to puke or had diarrhea. They couldn\u2019t clean the puke on the ground and they just put some talcum powder over it. Had to deal also with a lot of angry faces during the flight. By the time a arrived in Amsterdam, everything was fine again",
      "I was living in Key West and my Mom died very suddenly in Pennsylvania. I got on that plane and just cried for the entire flight. I felt awful for the people around me, not one person asked if I was okay though! I have never been so sad in my life. She died of a ruptured pancreas while taking a shower.",
      "I'm not stranger to turbulence, but a flight back from Hawaii to Seattle was the worst I've been through. Plane continued to drop and lurch up and drop and lurch up for an hour. People were screaming and puking and my knuckles were white from holding onto the arm rests. Closest I've been to thinking the plane was going down.",
      "I was crammed into an Iberian seat on a six hour flight...the seats are so small I actually started feeling claustrophobic. You literally could not retrieve something if you dropped it on the floor.  You had to either get the person next to you to stand for a minute, or wait until they went to the bathroom.\n\nThe woman next to me kept making these low-grad humming noises, the crew was obnoxious as hell, and the plane was filled with those weirdos who refuse to check luggage (on an international flight!), and through some magic were able to bring full size suitcases on the freaking plane.  There was no room in any overheads so I sat with my bag half way under my seat until a stewardess grabbed it, and brought it up to the front of the plane. When I told her I had to get some things out of the bag before she hid it, she just ignored me. \n\nThe plane was so cramped, you could not walk down the aisle without turning sideways. \n\nIt was terrifying and bizarre.   I have flown a lot of crappy airlines, but this was a new low. \n\nAnd this was the return trip.  The initial trip (heading to Madrid) was two hours late --almost everyone had connections---and the ground staff at the gate SAID NOTHING ABOUT IT.  No announcements about being late, no estimated time of departure.  \n\nAnd the worst part....and something I will never get over:  Madrid airport is a fucking nightmare.  You land in international, then have to walk a mile to passport control, get in line, get your luggage checked, then for some fucking weird reason, they send you through another passport line ....then you get to take a twenty minute train to get to your connecting flight....it was crazy figuring this out...you walk and walk and walk and finally see a sign for your gate....which is actually the weird train that will take you there.  So the packed train drops everyone off at the same place, and there is another mile long walk to get to your actual gate, because Iberian is so fucking cheap, they can't even get decent gates at their hub airport.  \n\nThey held the plane for me.  I was the last person on my connecting flight.  I have never seen the shitshow that is Iberian in all my years of travelling.",
      "I was flying USA to China via Heathrow (yes already a bad flight).\n\nAll packed, ready to go, Uber scheduled. \n\nI needed some spending money, but had already \"stored\" my car for insurance deduction, so I rode my bicycle to the bank. Quick ride, and done, plenty of time before Uber, right? \n\nComing home, slid in some gravel around a corner and skinned my arm severely, damaged my hand, and tore my pants. No time to suffer, hop back on and hurry home.\n\nWash up best I can, change clothes, arm still bleeding so add medicine, and wrap it in paper towels (no bandages at home). \n\nUber arrives, and I limp out to ride still in pain. Get to airport, check in and thunder storm comes, flight delayed 6 hours. I am still leaking fluids from scrape, and trying to keep it from ruining my clothes or grossing people out around me. \n\nFinally, get on flight and spend 12 hours in pain flying to Heathrow. \nBecause the flight was delayed, connecting flight to China already gone, but airlines book me on another airlines flight ANOTHER 6 hours later. I ask about luggage, and am told that will be transferred (you know this isn't happening, I did at the time too, but what can you do?) \n\nFinally get on second half flight at 10 pm, still hurting, still using paper towels to absorb body fluids and clothing now sticking to wound any chance it gets. \n\nArrive in China, and you guessed it, wait for an hour to ensure no luggage, and certainly no luggage. \n\nGet on bus to another city, still in pain, no change of clothes, and dragging carry-on with injured arm. \n\nI go to drug store and get medicine and bandages. Fortunately no infection!\n\n1 weeks later I finally track down luggage, and its delivered. \n\nNo compensation for lost luggage, or flight delay because it was due to \"act of nature\". \n\n3 months later, shoulder still hurt, yeah torn rotator.\n\nWorst trip ever.",

Sensory nightmare.",
      "On a recent 10-hour flight, the guy in the row in front of us started vomiting just after take off. We'd never heard someone puke so loudly or constantly before. I couldn't get my earbuds in fast enough to drown out the sounds. The flight attendant just kept giving him more puke bags to fill. We actually ended up donning our masks bc we had no idea if the dude had anything communicable. After at least an hour of this, we noticed the guy disappeared. He only returned at the end of the flight. We figure he found an empty seat near the bathroom or something?",

I had also gotten all my luggage stolen the day prior. It was a horrible experience lol.",
      "Wow this makes me grateful for my own experiences -- I thought I booked an exit row seat for a 15 hour flight. Turns out that row didn't actually have extra leg room and I had to squeeze into my seat because the guy in front of me was already reclined when I got there. When the flight attendant asked him to put his seat up, he said there was no button to do that (which they acknowledged was true). So he was reclined every moment of the 15 hours and I swear the broken chair was starting to lean even more as the flight went on. But that was just mild discomfort .. some of these stories are horrific.",

      "Not my stories -\n\n(1) A friend was on a flight home from a work trip. A boomer-esque drunk, disheveled \u201cbusinessman\u201d boarded and then (before takeoff) stood up, announced he had to use the bathroom, and headed to the loo. The entire flight had to wait on the tarmac for this \u201cbusinessman\u201d to do his \u201cbusiness\u201d before they could take off. He eventually emerged, red and sweaty. As he walked down the aisle, a piece of TP with *POOP ON IT* trailed behind him, tucked into and fluttering out from his pants. Small mercies, he was not seated next to my friend.\n\n(2) A different friend was also on a flight home from a work trip. Had the window seat. A 20-something single guy and a 20-something single girl had the middle and aisle seats. They hit it off on the flight, ordered a ton of drinks, got drunk, and started making out - while my friend cowered against the window. She is pretty sure they gave each other hand jobs. Cut to a few months later. She was at a restaurant and her server looked \u201cso familiar.\u201d And kept looking at her with embarrassment. Yep. It was the girl in the other seat.\n\nETA - (3) Kinda my story and *almost* a flight! For context, you need to know that me and my friend are both white Americans. We were in our mid-20s when this happened. She has long curly red hair, green eyes, and a ton of freckles. I had a short blond bob and blue eyes. Aside from being white women, we don\u2019t resemble each other.\n\nA friend was studying Mandarin in Beijing. I visited her and, for the end of my trip, we went together to Shanghai. She had a flight back to Beijing on a Sunday evening to get back for class on Monday. My flight home was the next Monday morning. On Sunday morning, we took a walk on the Bund and, spontaneously, bought corn-on-the-cob-on-a-stick from a street vendor. We each took about three bites before deciding it was rotten and tossing it. Soon after, we started to feel queasy. We said our goodbyes at the hotel looking green around the gills and she took a cab to the airport.\n\nI ended up puking, then feeling much better and going on with my day. I came back to the hotel at around 8 and learned that my friend was there in a courtesy room, asking to be let into my room (which they did not permit). Once reunited it was clear to me she had been crying and was not well. Once she and I got back to my room, she told me the following story:\n\nIn the cab it really hit her. She spent 20 minutes in agony trying not to shit her pants. Once at the airport, she raced to the closest bathroom, suitcase in tow. The stall had a squatting toilet (common in public bathrooms in China). She proceeded to squat for 20 minutes, shitting her bowels out, sweating, her legs shaking, her muscles nearly giving out. Once it was all over, she dragged herself in to check into her flight. It was here that she learned that she did not have her passport. She had mine. They were swapped by the front desk when we checked into the hotel. She was denied entry and had to take a cab back to the hotel. She ended up getting a flight the next day, but it was the worst flight that never was.",

      "US flight to Madrid, last year, observing 2 medical emergencies near me. One ended up being a woman who fainted in the aisle, but the other involved a wife loudly calling for help for her husband. The heart device was used and thankfully a Dr. was traveling with her young daughter, across the aisle. These both occurred about an hour from Madrid. We did get priority landing and medics boarded immediately. The ill man seemed to have recovered and walked off the plane.

Luckily, one of the two flights let me walk around a bit. That was one of the worse experiences. Trapped and your legs are under so much pressure.   \nFrom then on, compression socks. I even use them for short flights. Don't need to tell me twice. Good luck all flying long distances!",
      "Last time I flew home I had a 14 hour flight with a family of 2 grown brothers and their elderly mother sitting behind us. It was the second long leg of our 3 leg journey, and we were all ready for sleep. \n\nThe 2 brothers had some kind of disability and the mother was rough as guts shouting at them to settle down, while they in turn shouted back at both her and each other. They even tried to fight each other at times during the flight, despite one brother sitting in the next aisle over, in the middle seat. \n\nThe mother kept making loud racist remarks about people on the flight, like the young child who got up to go to the toilet when it so happened she wanted to go herself, (but never bothered to get up) and claimed he'd taken her spot and he shouldn't be allowed to go to 'her' toilet. She then went on to whine that (racist slur)'s had taken over the plane. She also made disgusting comments about our air hostess who was Asian, but when she was asked by the hostess if she wanted a cup of tea she was nice as pie to her, calling her 'sweetie' and 'dear' to her face, then back to slurs as soon as she was gone. \n\nOne of the brothers sat directly behind my 10 year old son, who was exhausted and had finally gotten to sleep after the excitement of the first long haul flight. The brother kicked his chair and talked so loudly that he woke up as he didn't like that I'd reclined my son's chair. My son was 10 years old and the brothers were in their 50s. The mother said nothing and pretended she couldn't hear me when I asked them to stop knocking his chair so he could sleep. \n\nNext the mother started berating my husband, sitting across the aisle from her, who had the audacity to blow his nose into a tissue. He didn't hear her as he was wearing noise cancelling headphones, but she went on and on about it loudly until I turned and looked at her.  \n\nLater on she realised the people 2 rows up were speaking Spanish, which prompted her to shout \"Speak English!\" at them in random intervals. She tutted and muttered loudly about how terrible it is that she has to listen to anything but English (on and Emirates flight from Dubai, no less) The Spanish girl asked me quite confused if there was a problem somewhere and I told her not to worry about the rude lady behind me. A few others joined me in saying she should ignore her. Throughout the entire flight she bitched and huffed at anyone walking past her aisle seat, until finally when I got up to stretch my legs and she did it to me I told her to shut up, we can all hear her and we were all sick of her whining and rudeness. She pretended she was asleep, but she most definitely was not. This stopped her making any noises for the rest of the flight almost until landing. \n\nAlso, every time she herself got up from her seat (of course it was ok if she did it) she needed to lean heavily on mine to get the leverage to swing up and out, which I didn't mind as she was in her 70s, but in doing so she had to swing her substantial backside out into the aisle, swiping the person in the opposite aisle seat in the face with her cheeks as she did so. As if this wasn't bad enough, it turns out she was wearing some sort of incontinence pad and had been dutifully filling it for the whole flight, and it was my husband who was chuffing her pee fumes every time she got up. By the end of the flight the smell of old urine had permeated well and truly, and my husband had reached for the sick bag on more than one occasion. \n\nTowards the end of the flight, the captain announced we were approaching Melbourne Airport, and that the hostesses were bringing around customs forms that everyone had to fill in. Cue the brothers starting a loud shouting match across the aisle about who had a pen, which would have come to fisticuffs had the mother not stepped in and shouted them to both shut the F up. I began to fill with terror as I imagined having to share the next flight to Tasmania with them, in a much smaller plane and very little circulating air.\nImagine my relief when the three of them suddenly began chanting \"We're in the best state! We're in the best state!\" As we descended into Tullamarine, safe in the knowledge that I would never see them again as long as I live.",

Two of the kids were incredibly sick (including the toddler) and alternating between wet coughing and crying the entire trip and wondering around the aisle. They were literally screaming \u201cI FEEL SO SICK\u201d over and over. Obviously sleep was out of the question but I am predictably very sick right now.",

I was exhausted by the time I got home.",

Shut the door behind us and escort us to the plane. Get to seat and the teenager in front of me had his seat leaned back so far that I could not utilize the seat pocket, tray, or store my stuff under the seat as I could not get down to it. Could not even receive food/beverage service. His mother sat across the aisle from him and kept turning around and giving me death stares like I was the issue. Attendants did nothing.",
      "Years ago, on a flight from Montreal to Vancouver the flight attendants were just about to close the front door to begin our taxiing.  The seat next to me was vacant, so I was excited to stretch out and sleep.  BUT, one more passenger was allowed on - a college kid and he sat down next to me.  He was sick the whole flight; threw up at least 6 times and the flight attendants thought we were together and kept handing me ginger ales to give him.  I actually did end up nursing him; I got more vomit bags for him and threw them away because the flight crew didn't want to assist him.  When we landed, he told me that he went directly to the airport from the bars - he'd been drinking all night on an empty stomach.",

To add to it I developed a fever, major stomach cramps, and a relentless cough.  The stewardesses were kind enough to move me to an open seat near the restrooms which has extra leg room, and loaded me up with blankets and water for the duration of the trip.  I got home, and crashed on the floor of my living room for about 12 hours straight.  Woke up and was right as rain.",

      "Little background first: I had been on a gluten free diet for about 5 years, and recently found out I'm not celiac. In that time, every flight I've book I've never remembered to check the box when you have dietary restrictions and need to get a special meal. So even despite not needing to eat gluten free, I checked the gluten-free box anyway on a United flight to Taipei from SFO. I had actually forgotten about this come time for the flight.\n\n\nI was surprised and happy to see I was presented with my gluten free breakfast. I don't remember all the things I was given, they were generally all good, but one of them was a gluten-free SUGAR-FREE muffin. I did not notice the second part at all. I don't know about most people, but my body cannot digest sugar alcohols AT ALL.\u00a0\n\n\nI ate my muffin, fell asleep, and was woken up by violent gas. I burped the largest burp I've ever burped in my life. I'm sitting in the middle between two young Taiwanese girls too, and I legitimately have zero control over my flatulence. My body is erupting with gas from both ends. I could only imagine what the effects of the lower pressure do on gas formation, too. It was super uncomfortable. I think I had to go to the bathroom a half dozen times to \"vent\". It was absolutely torture. I'm in extreme pain, can't think straight, can't sleep, can't be courteous to my neighbors... and it was at the front end of a 13-15 hr flight.\n\n\nTL;DR: Check the ingredients of your airplane food, and don't eat sugar free foods on an airplane (especially if you're sensitive to sugar alcohols!)",

The frustration and additional exhaustion because of a baby crying on a long haul can be hugely trying. \nWhen I had experiences of this nature I tried it all, the earbuds, reading and anything else I could think of.

I just recently returned from travelling and was presented with a super noisy airplane cabin.  I tried the new headphones and had themselves on \"quiet\" which is full noise cancelling.

His fingernails looked fossilised and I\u2019m quite sure he had double-fisted a lack of cigarettes just before boarding. I had the window, he had the middle. Non-stop flight from Dulles (Wash DC) to Tokyo.",

      "Yeah that's the worst",
      "I\u2019m really sorry this happened to you. I once saw a guy being taken off of the flight that landed before mine at LAX in handcuffs, as he molested a sleeping woman. The poor woman was crying talking to police. Everyone cheered as he passed in the cuffs. And it was what you would expect: an entitled middle-aged white guy",

      "Omg same here. I was on a flight to london and this dude was trying SO HARD to touch me. I was awake and whenever I \u2018closed my eyes\u2019 (I was secretly watching) he would slowwwwwwly move his hand to touch my thighs. Then I would pretend to rustle or wake up. \n\nHe had audacity to ask me if he can put his hand on my knees \ud83e\udd23 what a fucking creep",
      "I\u2019m so sorry that happened to you!!!",
      "I would have said loudly \"Get your hand off my thigh!\", called a stewardess, and asked for a seat change. \n\nI realize you were young. Stating this more for others. This is not okay!",

      "Happened to me from CDMX to NYC. Died in the lavatory both ends for six hours. Went to a clinic a day later when it didn\u2019t end. Doctor told me I won the bacteria lottery. Got pumped with an IV of antibiotics . Never have eaten street food in Mexico (or really anywhere) again",

      "God, same with food poisoning. Started to feel sick right before boarding a 13 hoir flight. I was caught in a vicious circle of being half asleep, waking up because I felt like puking, going to the bathroom for puking or diarrhea, back to my seat to try and catch some sleep, aaaaaaaand repeat. \n\nEvery. Forty. Minutes. For 13 hours. Terrible.",
      "Reminds me of a similar experience I had - I was flying to Queenstown NZ from Melbourne and the night before my early morning flight I was throwing my guts up from food poisoning, didn\u2019t sleep a wink. Felt like garbage and was battling the urge to be sick at the airport the whole time. Within ten minutes of takeoff I was into the toilet for what felt like hours (but was probably only 10-15 minutes) of projectile vomiting. Like you, I also realised I can lie in the fetal position. \n\nCouldn\u2019t eat anything for another three days, and over the course of two weeks I had lost around 6kg. Fun times!",
      "For some reason food poisoning hits me harder than most. Spent Christmas in a hospital in China (I\u2019m American) because of it. Nothing like taking a wheelchair ride through the largest casino floor in the world looking like hot shit on a stick. \n\nThe real cherry on top is getting to the hospital and being so dehydrated that no one can properly place the IV and you go through 5 nurses, 7 needle pricks between both arms, and a sonogram machine just to get an IV. \n\nFor all my troubles, everything ended up being $120 out the door. Including all medical services, ambulance, and prescription. Bonkers.",
      "6 months pregnant flying from Canada to Venezuela. Hit a bit of turbulence and I started feeling nauseous.  Went back to the bathroom just in case I needed to vomit.  Walked into the lavatory to find both the toilet full to the brim with pee, shit and paper with vomit floating on top. The sink was so full of vomit it was spilling out over the top. I backed out of that horror show and walked up and down the aisles until it was time to land.  It was too gross to be sick in.",
      "Omg  you win.",
      "I threw up when my train lurched forward, and it all landed on my brand new jacket that was sitting on the table. I cleaned it up w lysol wipes and then spent the entire time from Zermatt to Paris curled up on the bathroom floors of the THREE different trains throughout the journey, puking intermittently into the toilet. \n\nAbsolutely disgusting \ud83d\ude02 I didn\u2019t touch alcohol for 3 months after that",
      "You poor thing. That's AWFUL. I've had horrible food poisoning to where I just slept on the floor and I cannot imagine that happening to me on a plane.",
      "Not me but my buddy got sick in Honduras when we were coming back from a medical trip. As soon as we hit cruising altitude he went to the bathroom and didn't come back until we were descending 6 hours later. Said he was shitting the entire time.",

      "Shout out to the food poisoning gang. Mine started lightly in LAX and got worse during the flight to Auckland. Best way to fly with a private room for the price of economy. Upon arriving in Auckland, between exhaustion from the experience and jet lag i literally slept through a fire in the hotel.

      "LMAO\u2014I\u2019ve got almost the exact same experience. We flew in on a chartered Atlas 747 right after Christmas 2002. So probably 300 or so infantrymen farting, sweating, and belching their Christmas dinners back into the non-filtered and recirculated atmosphere of a 40-year old jet, all the way to Kuwait City. Pilot told us \u201cGodspeed\u201d as we deplaned and I figured I\u2019d just survived the worst already.",

      "This happened to me once but on the way to the bathroom! God I try to block that memory out. It was a Boston to Zurich flight then I had a Zurich to Johannesburg flight that one of the original flight attendants was on as a passenger. During the second flight he\u2019d check in with me on his way to the bathroom which was very nice but added to my embarrassment.",

      "If you hang out much with MDs in social settings, a great genre of recurring anecdote you get is \"The time I was on a flight and they called for a doctor.\" \n\nThe common theme is that if you're an actual doctor, the last thing you could possibly want to do in the middle of a flight is get up from your seat and practice medicine.  Of course, you *will*, because you're not an asshole, but only after trying to ascertain if someone else equally qualified, more eager (and who has possibly been enjoying fewer in-flight beverages) will respond before you, and if the emergency in question needs actual medical attention. \n\nA lot of these anecdotes follow the pattern of \"they called for a doctor, I took my time responding to let someone else, but then some dumbass pre-med student/chiropractor/person who once took a first aid course volunteered, and I figured I'd better step in.\"  \n\nThose are good, but I have two favorites.  \n\nMy 2nd favorite was the story told by a well-qualified surgeon who was on their way to a family vacation to Hawaii.  Their family had gotten split up across the cabin, and the surgeon was a couple-drinks in to enjoying their vacation when they heard the \"is there a doctor on board\" call come across the PA.  They looked around, and were relieved to see another actual qualified physician respond, and head back to another part of the plane. \n\nShortly after, the surgeon fell asleep.  An hour or so later, the responding physician was at the surgeon's seat gently waking them up.  The physician explained that there was nothing to worry about, but the surgeon's teenage son sitting in another part of the plane had fainted, and the physician had given the son an IV and he was going to be just fine.  The surgeon, of course, never admitted his profession, thanked the physician profusely and went to check on his son and swear him to eternal silence.\n\nBUT - my *all time favorite* was told by a physician who was taking an international overnight flight.  She got on board, settled down, and took a couple Ambien. \n\nShe had a wonderful sleep, and didn't wake up until her destination. \n\nAs she was deplaning after landing, she was surprised when the stewardess stopped her, took her hand and said, \"thank you for all your help, I don't know what we would have done without you.\" \n\nIt turns out that during the flight while the plane was over the Atlantic, a passenger had a medical emergency.  Under the influence of Ambien, the physician had taken over, administered medication, oxygen and set an IV, stabilized the patient enough that the flight didn't have to divert, and then gone back to their seat to continue their sleep.  \n\nThanks to the Ambien, the physician had absolutely zero memory of these events, and had to be reassured by the flight crew that yes, in fact, they had happened and the patient was just fine. \n\nHer anecdote ended with, \"So, I don't take Ambien any more when I fly.\"",
      "I used to faint a lot (it stopped after going vegan a few years ago). I've fainted during museum tours, one memorable time in front of a beehive on a school trip, during a class presentation, in the middle of a haka... Frankly, it was so normal for me that I never felt embarrassed by it.",
      "Oh gosh my partner had something similar recently on our flight to Australia. He felt all woozy and sick and then passed out (with his eyes open!).

I have to say of the what felt like 800 kids aboard the flight they were the most behaved by far.  But to accomplish this the Father looped a 1.5 min video of the song \"You have a friend in me\" that included baby sounds and pans banging.  Over and over and over again.  \n\nAt some point an older kid started \"walking\" arm rest to arm rest on the aisle seats in a zig zag pattern.  Just as she got to the woman's seat across from me and stepped down the whole armrest gave ea and snapped off.   \n\nOnce we landed before even getting to the gate the guy infront of me stood up and opened the overhead bin.

I\u2019d keep waking up looking like we were a couple, and not wanting to be nor look like a creep I would lightly nudge until she would momentarily wake and fall asleep upwards. This repeated no less than a dozen times, and eventually she started alternating between me and the other middle aged guy on her other side where it continued the rest of the flight. She spoke no English, and never made eye contact with her the whole flight as she was always shrunk into her hoodie.\n\nWas kind of funny and adorable the first time because I\u2019ve seen it happen all the time in Japan on the subway and it was accidental, but boy did it become an invasion of space quickly, not to mention waking me every 20-30 minutes.",

Luckily most people spoke English but even the doctor asked why I didn\u2019t come sooner because that strep was taking me out! I got the antibiotics (for free / covered by my travelers insurance which was very cheap) and slept for 2 days (setting alarms only to take the antibiotics) when I woke up after 2 days I was hungry",

I have a dear friend with a teen who is unable to change their own diaper, and this is one of the reasons they bought first-class seats on a highly-rated airline; the flight attendants had an area they allowed the family and their nurse to use for this purpose, away from other passengers.

But I couldn\u2019t get around all the questions about why you would go to a city that I found charming, exciting and beautiful.\u00a0\n\nI came into Dhaka via bus from a lime-green countryside and got dropped off in chaotic traffic circle. Took an auto rickshaw to the nice part of town and found a scorching hot, quiet modern section. Nice cafes, splendid food, shade under trees.\n\nI spent four days taking long walks all the way down from Banani through a lazy rest in Ratna park, through Old Dhaka to the river where brightly painted riverboats share the river with rowing men.\u00a0\n\nEach afternoon I hopped on a packed city bus and hug out the door in traffic and jumped to my other bus while stopped at a traffic light.\u00a0\n\nThen walked the last kilometer along the big lake where prayer calls come softly from the other shore.\n\nThere\u2019s a trash river somewhere too, but that\u2019s not what I came for.",

If you get a chance to go to Bangladesh again, do visit the south-east\u2014Cox's bazaar has one of the longest sea beaches in the world, and there are quiet, peaceful stretches of sand away from the main crowded areas. The hill country is beautiful (relatively escaped a lot of the pollution and overpopulation of elsewhere) and a cultural treat with a host of tribal peoples and their unique culture.\u00a0\n\n\nHonestly, everywhere has terrible places and beautiful places.

We've been to Vegas before and that was also great - maybe it'd be good to go back if being there for NYE is especially fun.\n\nWe're overall quite flexible with if the draw to the city is more cultural, adventurous, nature, party, etc. I think we just want to have a memorable experience and there's cool stuff going on - especially going out for NYE.

Probably 1-2 bases with a couple day trips. Guatemala (Guatemala City, Antigua, Lake Atitlan). Panama (Panama City, the canal and maybe Boco del Toro if possible).

Panama is a little easier than the other two and would be my choice out of those 3.  It's got the best food, highest standard of living and is generally the easiest.  If you go to Bocas you'll want to fly but be cautioned it can feel like a backpacker scene unless you're willing to spend on nicer resorts.  Closer and quieter would be Isla Taboga, the pearl islands and the beaches of the Azuero peninsula.\n\nKids that age won't enjoy the city stops and may actually make you enjoy it less.  My advice is that slightly more popular destinations in the region will most likely be easier/more enjoyable - consider Costa Rica (cloud forest, volcanoes, beaches), the Yucatan (beaches and Mayan ruins), the cayes of Belize (beaches) or Puerto Rico (San Juan, beaches, jungle) instead.

They confirmed my booking and sent me my ticket number/booking id/etc. Fastfoward to a week before my trip, I realize that my flight to Seoul doesn\u2019t include a checked luggage so I attempt to log in and view my trip on the airline website just to find out that my ticket number and booking doesn\u2019t exist. Called the airline to confirm and sure enough no reservation was ever made in my name. \nI called Agoda 4 days ago to inquire about this and ask where I can get confirmation for my flight/hotel because nothing had been booked. They said they would get back to me within 48 hours but didn\u2019t. So I called again and again they said they would get back to me within 48 hours but I\u2019m scheduled to depart before that. So what do I do? Agoda did say they would refund me if I were unable to go on this trip. However I\u2019m going on this trip to take a test only available in Seoul in December. I\u2019ve booked and payed for the test along with things such as concert tickets. This is the last opportunity for me to take this test and it would cost me much more than just the Agoda booking price to not go on this trip. ",

It\u2019s the best way to try and limit complications rather than get a 3rd party involved. Sorry this happened to you\u2026\n\nI recommend you continue calling in, don\u2019t take no for an answer and ask to escalate (and make sure you get your case number to reference if you don\u2019t have it already).

Your odds of getting money back that way is a lot lower, though. \n\nAlso, since you have the alleged ticket number, check the first 3 digits. They represent the airline. Is it the same airline?

      "**Did you or are you about to buy a flight via an Online Travel Agency (OTA)?** Please read this notice.\n\nAn Online Travel Agency (OTA) is a website that allows you to search for and buy airfare/flight tickets. Common ones include Expedia, Priceline, Flighthub, Kiwi, Hopper. Even when you redeem points on [credit card travel portals](https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/152lx5b/wiki_portal_booking_pros_and_cons/) you are actually purchasing a cash ticket through the Credit Card's OTA. Some examples are Chase Travel, AMEX Travel, Capital One Travel.\n\nAlmost all OTAs suffer from the same problem:  a lack of customer service and competency when it comes to voluntary changes, cancellations, refunds, airline schedule changes and cancellations, and [IRROPs, even in the middle of your trip](https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/1egftbw/stranded_at_airport_with_both_agency_and_airline/).\n\nWhen you buy a flight ticket through an OTA, you put an intermediary between you and the airline. This means you are *not* the airline's customer and if you try to contact the airline for any assistance, they will simply tell you to work with your travel agency (the OTA). **The airline generally can't and won't help you**. They do not have control over the ticket until T-24h and even then, they can still decline to assist you and [ask you to talk to your OTA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/ztt38s/expedia_fkked_up_my_flight_tickets_and_made_me/).\n\nCertain OTAs, such as [kiwi.com](http://kiwi.com), will mash together separately issued tickets creating a false sense of proper layovers/connections but in reality are [self-transfers](https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/16ym47p/comment/k39c52x/) - which come with a *lot* more planning and contingencies. Read the linked guide to better understand them. This includes dealing with single-leg cancellations of your completely disjointed itinerary. Read here for a [terrible example](https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/vo8d0b/one_of_my_flights_got_cancelled_on_kiwicom_and/). Here is [another one](https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/vwckji/kiwicom_schedule_changes/).\n\nOther OTAs, especially lesser-known discount brands, as well as [Trip.com](http://Trip.com), [don't always issue your tickets](https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/113jt49/how_long_does_it_take_for_tripcom_to_issue_flights/) immediately (*or at all*). There have been known instances where the OTA contacts you 24-72h later asking for more money as \"the price has changed\" or the ticket you originally tried to reserve is no longer available at the low price. See [here for example](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/10rjnux/travelcation_is_a_scam/).\n\nHowever, not all OTAs are created equal - some more reputable ones like expedia group, priceline, and some travel portals like Chase Travel, AMEX Travel, Capital One Travel, Costco Travel, generally have fewer issues with regards to issuing tickets and have marginally better customer service. They are also more transparent when they are caching stale prices as you try to check out and pay, they will do a live refresh of the real ticket price and warn you that prices have changed (*no, it is not a bait and switch*).\n\n**In short**: OTAs sometimes have their place for *some* people but most of the time, especially for simple roundtrip itineraries, provide no benefit and only increases the risk of something going wrong and costing a lot more than what you had potentially saved by buying from the OTA.\n\n**Common issues you will face:**\n\n* [missing communications from your OTA](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1egily7/how_bookingcoms_communication_error_cost_me_my/) due to your email or spam settings\n* paying the OTA to add checked or carryon baggage but not communicated to the airline [#1](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1e34vbe/dont_book_kiwicom_with_checked_bags/) [#2](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1eq3hn5/purchasing_baggage_using_lytravelgo/) [#3](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1evj0b9/priceline_scamming_on_baggage_fees/)\n* [paying the OTA for overpriced baggage compared to the airline](https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/zq0zsy/kiwi_absurd_prices_for_baggage/)\n* [paying the OTA for baggage that's already included](https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/129dbv2/free_included_baggages_with_china_southern/)\n* [paying the OTA for seat selection that's not communicated to the airline](https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/1h1e9sm/tripcom/)\n* [your ticket not issuing or delayed issuing](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ajpue6/do_not_book_with_lycom/) or transaction being reversed\n* [your name being incorrectly spelled on your eticket?](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gb664g/question_about_booking_via_traveloka_theyre/)\n* [difficulties changing flights](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1bip4ci/warning_gotogates_deceptive_practices_left_me/) or finding anyone competent enough to help\n* charging you for a check-in service that is free?\n* [enrollment in a subscription program](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/jndk97/does_anybody_know_if_edreamscom_is_a_reliable/) that is hard/impossible to cancel [#1](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1d4h07d/edreams_prime_cancellation/) [#2](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1byx35q/edreams_prime_worst_thing_i_have_experienced_in_a/) [#3](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1dcifez/edreams_cancel_prime_after_charges_on_credit_card/) [#4](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1bw12to/trying_to_cancel_prime_but_edreams_customer/) [#5](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/17w3ie6/the_edreams_travel_agent_scam_lies_about/) [#6](https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/1emkzdj/cancelling_opodo_prime_before_the_end_of_the_30/)\n* [not honouring free changes or cancellations](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/wrfsap/kiwicom_is_a_scam_please_dont_use_it/) when airline reschedules\n* or (secretly) booking your trip [as two separate tickets for the outbound and return](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ens2il/flight_network_a_thirdparty_vendor_and_their/) so that if the airline cancels or reschedules the outbound, only the first leg is eligible for a refund (or free change)\n* not refunding you promptly (or at all) [#1](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1e128tp/bookingcom_flight_was_cancelled_by_airline_2/) [#2](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1egrlt8/kiwicom_not_paying_full_amount_to_airline/) [#3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/1en92am/gotogate_vs_spirit_airlines_refund/) when the airline cancels [#4](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gobnnu/how_to_lose_515_eur_with_edreams_without_flying/) [#5](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gx0w33/flighthub_is_still_a_scam/)\n* [not subject to the DOT 24h free cancellation](https://www.flyertalk.com/forum/online-travel-booking-bidding-agencies/1681828-us-dot-24-hour-cancellation-flights-doesn-t-apply-online-travel-agencies.html) regulation\n* [unuseable kiwi credits](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1819bkf/kiwicom_never_book_your_flights_here/) after the airline declines issuing a ticket instead of a refund\n\n**Things you should do, if you've already purchased from an OTA:**\n\n* check your reservation (PNR) with the airline website directly\n* check your eticket has been issued - look for 13-digit number(s) - ***a PNR is not enough***\n* [garden your ticket](https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/15bwqzb/wiki_basic_management_of_an_award_ticket/) - check back on it regularly\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I initially thought, oh, geez, they don\u2019t want us talking, but how the heck could the enforce it. But it isn\u2019t that. It is that they do not have those aggravating blaring PA announcements. It is so different. As soon as I land elsewhere, I feel assaulted. I don\u2019t know that someone posting on Reddit will make any difference in the world. But if port authorities or others would consider this idea, the world would be well served.

If there is a natural disaster or civil upheaval to the point where civilians are being evacuated, the United States covers evacuation of American citizens.

They bill themselves as a high risk rescue/evacuation company with marketing materials that make it sound on par with an executive protection service\u2026.but from what I can tell, they do not actually offer any of the services, they just provide insurance to pay for them. Maybe. If it qualifies. There will be no team of Aegis contractors swooping in to save you. Just an insurance adjuster on the back side.",

Most running shoes (like what is being suggested here) are purpose made for running.  I've tried just about everything out there for long days of walking and without fail my feet would be aching by the end of the day.  I finally gave the Altras, which are fairly minimalist, zero drop, wide toebox shoes, and all of my problems went away.  No more aching feet.  No more blisters.  No more shoes that take days to dry out after getting wet.  I suggest the barefoot sandals because they're so easy to pack, extremely comfortable once you adjust to them (they're all I wear now), and it doesn't matter if they get wet.  Great backup pair to have in case something happens to the primary (though some nicer places may frown on sandals).",

I would suggest going to a running specific store with a wide selection and work with someone there to find what model fits your foot best, then get it in a dark colourway as it's less likely to show dirt and stains.\n\n\nPersonally, I travel with a pair of Adidas triple black ultraboosts and a pair of black or white adidas stan smiths depending on what weather I expect.",

    "text": "Me and my best friend are both females want to visit Africa in 2025 (Both in mid 20). None of us have been to Africa continent before so we are still deciding which country to visit. Since we only have 10 days, we are thinking to just visit 2 countries and our top choices would be South Africa and Namibia (idk if 10 days are enough). I am not sure what is the best way to explore. I traveled a lot to Europe, Asia, America and I don't usually go with a tour. I rented a car, explored by myself, researched online, etc. I am not sure how it would be in South Africa or Namibia tho. We want to travel by our own, rent a car, and pick nice stay. However, I am sure visiting safari for example, we probably need to book a tour specific for that. \n\n  \nMy only concern is the safety to drive somewhere far (human/ animal). For example, in US, I can just drive to national park or somewhere far and I am not afraid driving in remote area because I know I can call 911 if something happens. While in Africa, I don't know if I would end up driving with tiger on my side lol \n\n  \nShould we just go with a tour? Any recommended tour that is not crazy expensive?\n\nIs it safe to just explore our own and book a tour for specific experience (e.g. safari)?\n\nWhat are things that I need to consider?\n\n  \nThank you very much :)",

If I had a daughter in her 20\u2019s, I would pay for a guide to ensure she had a good time that was safe.",
      "Your worry when driving in South Africa, from what I understand, is not the possibility of wild animals running alongside your car. (You don't get tigers in Africa anyway, unless you're for some reason driving round a zoo.)",
      "100% With 10 days, your time is limited. The benefit of the tour on Safari is that the guides talk to each other so you'll be able to see the most animals.\n\n\nConsider Acacia tours or Intrepid. They both have great small group tours that I've enjoyed.",
      "With only 10 days, I\u2019d recommend you stick to one country. The continent is HUGE and individual countries are likely larger than you expect. \n\nYou could do 10 days in South Africa starting in Cape Town and then flying to Johannesburg to do a safari.\nOr you could fly into Nairobi, Kenya, and do a safari there. \nOr, you could go all around Morocco (cities and deserts). \nNamibia you would need at least 10 days in because the country is SO vast.",
      "Africa is HUGE, you definitely need to be more specific in what countries you want to visit. \n\nWhat is it you want to see? South Africa isn\u2019t really safe to drive yourself as women.",
      "It depends on a few factors. \n\nOne is your experience and comfort level with traveling in the developing world. While both South Africa and Namibia are known for having better tourist infrastructure than other African countries, it will still be very different from what you're used to in the US/Canada/Western Europe, etc. \n\nA second factor is your expectations for the trip. If your goal is to maximize relaxation and minimize frustration, then a package tour can be well worth it.\n\nIf you're new to traveling in the developing world, and just want to enjoy your safari and not deal with the stress of language barriers, safety issues, bribes/corruption, finding safe transportation, etc - just spend extra on the package tour and let the experts take care of all that.",

      "(F 29) I traveled to South Africa, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Zambia alone last winter. The cheapest safari tour I found was in Botswana; I paid $20 for 3 hours and saw almost all the animals. Victoria Falls, located on the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe, is an amazing place. I enjoyed Namibia the most and want to return there again. However, I felt uncomfortable in South Africa, especially when I was at the bus stations in Cape Town and Johannesburg",
      "Where are you travelling from? You need to build in time for jet lag. \n\nWe're on east coast USA and build in an extra day before starting safari. You'll be exhausted. And it's less expensive to stay near the airport one night than what a lodge typically costs. \n\nAnd is it 10 days total or is that just safari portion? If 10 days total that could give you 7 days in camps. We usually do only two camps, rather than changing every night or two. If you're on a tour you won't have control over how long you stay in each camp. \n\nRecommend picking just one or two adjacent countries (like Kenya & Tanzania). For South Africa you could pair safari with Cape Town.\n\nFor your first visit, I recommend a tour. After that, you can work with a travel agent to build a custom itinerary. I only use travel agents for Africa, as you can't really put it together easily (and the agent will know any camp discounts and can guide you by budget and what you want to experience). \n\nWarning: Once you go, you'll have to go back.",

      "1st trip to that continent, yes, a tour. Next trip, you can venture on your own. I am saying this because Africa will attack all your senses at once, beyond anything you have experienced before.",

      "I spent a month traveling Tanzania with a guide (climbing Kilimanjaro + safari). It is different with the national parks there because of poaching and protection of the animals. Permits are required for some parks and tour guide companies take care of all that. I loved it so much I\u2019m planning to go back to Namibia and Botswana May 2025 and will self drive. \nFrom what I learned while being there, Namibia is easier to do a self drive (lots of YouTube videos and blogs documenting this) - but South Africa to Namibia in 10 days is a lot to accomplish. The roads are often just dirt so it\u2019s slow travel (not like our national parks in the US). \n\nI\u2019d suggest looking on YouTube to see what\u2019s there when it comes to driving South Africa to Namibia. That\u2019s how I plan a lot of my own travel itineraries. It\u2019s worked out great so far! I even roadtripped from Colorado down to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico over 5 weeks with mostly beach camping.",
      "As a young woman myself, I happened to travel to Livingstone Zambia for work on a large project. Breaking off with a couple girls to travel afterwards was incredible.. Livingstone was the perfect area to explore not only Zambia, but also Zimbabwe and Botswana. We did a safari in Botswana, walked into Zimbabwe from the Victoria falls and rode elephants, and we pet tigers in Zambia. There was so much to do while using Livingstone as a home base. I\u2019d also suggest hiring a driver (super cheap) to take you everywhere and recommend local food spots. DM me if you have more specific questions :) wherever you decide you\u2019ll have fun!",
      "I would recommend Rythm Africa.  They can arrange all your hotels and flights (flights can be difficult due to card and bank issues).  These guys are a call away if you experience problems while you do your self tour.  I would suggest Sabi Sands and the Inyati Lodge for 3 days for your safari.  They can also arrange that.  It is the absolute best trip I have ever taken.  We did drive all over around Cape Town and the wine region, but decided we would never do that again.  I am just saying it is up to you.  Contact and discuss with Rythm Africa.  Very good pricing.",

Not many people in Namibia, heaps of amazing wildlife, great variety of nature.\u00a0\n\n\nFor pure Safari's and wildlife, I think you'll struggle to find better than Botswana - we only spent time in the north near Kasane (Chobe National Park). So many animals, so close by, etc.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd from Kasane, you can easily go and see Victoria Falls / Livingstone for a day or 2/3.\u00a0\n\n\nLet us know what you end up deciding.\u00a0",
      "I've been to Africa several times and I would recommend doing tours (preferably longer ones through companies like GAdventures or Intrepid, but smaller tours with reputable local providers if necessary).\n\nThe tourist and transit infrastructure is much less developed than you would be used to in Asia or Europe, and as others have said, there's large swathes of the continent that would be genuinely quite unsafe (particularly for two young women on their own). It's an unfortunate reality. \n\nThere's so many incredible places to experience there - you'll have a much better experience by travelling in a tour that substantially reduces the logistical and safety concerns vs. trying to wing it like you can in other parts of the world.",

      "There is no need for a tour for SA or Namibia.  \"Self-drive\" as they call it, is very popular in Namibia and South Africa and elsewhere in southern Africa.  \n\nIn both of those countries there are national parks that can be easily visited on your own, just like national parks in Europe and North America.  \n\nFor 10 days, just concentrate on one country - there's no enough time to do justice to 2.  I actually think South Africa is an excellent \"first stop\" for visiting Africa.  It's easy to get around, safe outside of areas of Johannesburg and Cape Town, and affordable.  Kruger National Park would be my choice for a first time game viewing.  The in-park lodging is reasonably priced and while not fancy, perfectly fine.\n\nOff the main freeways the roads can be rough but I've had no problem with a Toyota Corolla.  (There are some parks where you'd need 4x4 but not Kruger).\n\nYou would have time to visit Eswatini too, which can be a nice diversion for a couple days.",

Inbound when we talked with locals the first question was \u201care you going with a tour or are you on your own?\u201d  After replying that we are with a tour, the universal response went something like \u201cGood, South Africa is a beautiful country, but it is not entirely safe for tourists on their own.\u201d  One person said, \u201cif you have been here several times before and really know your way around it may be safe (to be on your own).\u201d  We had an amazing time and felt very safe throughout the trip.   Accommodations, service, food, etc. were all excellent.",

My family and I pick where we want to visit and then make arrangements through the hotel front desk, including drivers from the airport. Cape Town is amazing and there's lots of jumping off points for safari all along the coast. The moonscape in Namibia is pretty cool, too."

      "What we're looking for here for is, I think - and this is no more than an educated guess, I'd like to make that clear - is some multicellular life form with stripes, huge razor-sharp teeth, about eleven feet long, and of the genus felis horribilis - what we doctors, in fact, call a 'tiger'.\n\nA tiger? In Africa?",
      "We did have a lion lie down in the road in front of our car in Etosha National Park in Namibia, but this wasn't exactly a problem. She knew we were there to see her anyway.\n\nNot a tiger, though.",
      "Im going to say this. I went with Intrepid, and while the tour was great, I was basically sexually harassed by the guide for 10 days. It was only later I figured out the tour was sub contracted out. \n\nYes, I would go with a tour, but I wouldn\u2019t say a specific company. I\u2019ve just found a lot of variation.",
      "They want to go to either Sudan, Cape Verde or Namibia. I can't quite work out which.",
      "Absolutely!",
      "I just did a two and a half week trip to Namibia recently, which was my first time on the continent. While we were with a group, most of what we did were activities that a person could easily arrange on their own (staying in rest camps and doing a park safari), and we met quite a few people who had done just that. We had 4x4s but saw a few sedans tooling around Etosha.",
      "What do you mean by arrangements through the hotel front desk? \n\n  \nAlso, I feel you about SF. I lived in SF in 2018, and it was terrible!"
